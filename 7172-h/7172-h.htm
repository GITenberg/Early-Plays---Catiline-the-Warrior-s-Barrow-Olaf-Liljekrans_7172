    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the most remarkable facts about Ibsen is the orderly development of
      his genius. He himself repeatedly maintained that his dramas were not mere
      isolated accidents. In the foreword to the readers in the popular edition
      of 1898 he urges the public to read his dramas in the same order in which
      he had written them, deplores the fact that his earlier works are less
      known and less understood than his later works, and insists that his
      writings taken as a whole constitute an organic unity. The three of his
      plays offered here for the first time in English translation will afford
      those not familiar with the original Norwegian some light on the early
      stages of his development.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catiline</i>, the earliest of Ibsen's plays, was written in 1849, while
      Ibsen was an apothecary's apprentice in Grimstad. It appeared in
      Christiania in the following spring under the pseudonym Brynjolf Bjarme.
      The revolutionary atmosphere of 1848-49, the reading of the story of
      Catiline in Sallust and Cicero in preparation for the university
      examinations, the hostility which existed between the apprentice and his
      immediate social environment, the fate which the play met at the hands of
      the theatrical management and the publishers, his own struggles at the
      time,&mdash;are all set forth clearly enough in the preface to the second
      edition. The play was written in the blank verse of Oehlenschlaeger's
      romantic dramas. Ibsen's portrayal of the Roman politician is not in
      accord with tradition; Catiline is not an out-and-out reprobate, but an
      unfortunate and highly sensitive individual in whom idealism and
      licentiousness struggle for mastery. Vasenius, in his study of the poet (<i>Ibsens
      Dramatiska Diktning in dess Första Skede</i>, Helsingfors, 1879), insists
      that Ibsen thus intuitively hit upon the real Catiline revealed by later
      nineteenth century research. The poet seems not to have heard of Duma's <i>Catiline</i>,
      which appeared about the same time, nor of earlier plays on the subject by
      Ben Jonson and others. The struggle in Ibsen's play is centered in the
      soul of Catiline; not once do his political opponents appear on the scene.
      Only one critic raised his voice in behalf of the play at the time of its
      appearance, and only a few copies of the original edition survive. Ibsen
      issued in 1875 a revised edition in celebration of his twenty-fifth
      anniversary as an author. Since then a third edition has been issued in
      1891, and a fourth in 1913.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Warrior's Barrow</i>, Ibsen's second play, was finished in 1850
      shortly after the publication of <i>Catiline</i>. Ibsen entered upon his
      literary career with a gusto he seems soon to have lost; he wrote to his
      friend Ole Schulerud in January, 1850, that he was working on a play about
      Olaf Trygvesson, an historical novel, and a longer poem. He had begun <i>The
      Warrior's Barrow</i> while he was still at Grimstad, but this early
      version, called <i>The Normans</i>, he revised on reaching Christiania. In
      style and manner and even in subject-matter the play echoes
      Oehlenschlaeger. Ibsen's vikings are, however, of a fiercer type than
      Oehlenschlaeger's, and this treatment of viking character was one of the
      things the critics, bred to Oehlenschlaeger's romantic conception of more
      civilized vikings, found fault with in Ibsen's play. The sketch fared
      better than <i>Catiline</i>: it was thrice presented on the stage in
      Christiania and was on the whole favorably reviewed. When Ibsen became
      associated with the Bergen theater he undertook another revision of the
      play, and in this version the play was presented on the stage in 1854 and
      1856. The final version was published in the <i>Bergenske Blad</i> in
      1854, but no copy of this issue has survived; the play remained
      inaccessible to the public until 1902, when it was included in a
      supplementary volume (Volume X) to Ibsen's collected works. The earlier
      version remained in manuscript form until it was printed in 1917 in <i>Scandinavian
      Studies and Notes</i> (Vol. IV, pp. 309-337).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Olaf Liljekrans</i>, which was presented on the Bergen stage in 1857,
      marks the end of Ibsen's early romantic interest. The original idea for
      this play, which he had begun in 1850, he found in the folk-tale "The
      Grouse in Justedal," about a girl who alone had survived the Black Death
      in an isolated village. Ibsen had with many others become interested in
      popular folk-tales and ballads. It was from Faye's <i>Norwegian Folk-Tales</i>
      (1844) that he took the story of "The Grouse in Justedal." His interest
      was so great that he even turned collector. Twice during this period he
      petitioned for and received small university grants to enable him to
      travel and "collect songs and legends still current among the people." Of
      the seventy or eighty "hitherto unpublished legends" which he collected on
      the first of these trips only a few have ever appeared in print; the
      results of his second trip are unknown. Ibsen had great faith in the
      availability of this medieval material for dramatic purposes; he even
      wrote an essay, "The Heroic Ballad and Its Significance for Artistic
      Poetry," urging its superior claims in contrast to that of the saga
      material, to which he was himself shortly to turn. The original play based
      on "The Grouse in Justedal" was left unfinished. After the completion of
      <i>Lady Inger of Östråt</i> and <i>The Feast at Solhoug</i> he came back
      to it, and taking a suggestion from the ballad in Landstad's collection
      (1852-3) he recast the whole play, substituted the ballad meter for the
      iambic pentameters, and called the new version <i>Olaf Liljekrans</i>. <i>Olaf
      Liljekrans</i> indicates clearly a decline in Ibsen's interest in pure
      romance. It is much more satirical than <i>The Feast at Solhoug</i>, and
      marks a step in the direction of those superb masterpieces of satire and
      romance, <i>Brand</i> and <i>Peer Gynt</i>. The play was twice presented
      on the stage in Bergen with considerable success, but the critics treated
      it harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship of the revised versions to the original versions of
      Ibsen's early plays is interesting, and might, if satisfactorily
      elucidated, throw considerable light on the development of his genius. It
      is evident that he was in this early period experimenting in metrical
      forms. He employed blank verse in <i>Catiline</i>, in the original version
      of <i>The Grouse in Justedal</i>, and even as late as 1853 in the revision
      of <i>The Warrior's Barrow</i>. There can be no question but that he was
      here following the Ochlenschlaeger tradition. Unrhymed pentameter,
      however, did not seem to satisfy him. He could with difficulty keep from
      falling into rhyme in <i>Catiline</i>, and in the early version of <i>The
      Warrior's Barrow</i> he used rhymed pentameters. After the revision of
      this play he threw aside blank verse altogether. "Iambic pentameter," he
      says in the essay on the heroic ballad, "is by no means the most suitable
      form for the treatment of ancient Scandinavian material; this form of
      verse is altogether foreign to our national meters, and it is surely
      through a national form that the national material can find its fullest
      expression." The folk-tale and the ballad gave him the suggestion he
      needed. In <i>The Feast at Solhoug</i> and the final version of <i>Olaf
      Liljekrans</i> he employed the ballad meter, and this form became the
      basis for the verse in all his later metrical plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six years intervened between <i>The Grouse in Justedal</i> and <i>Olaf
      Liljekrans</i>, and the revision in this case amounted almost to the
      writing of a new play. Fredrik Paasche in his study (<i>Olaf Liljekrans</i>,
      Christiania, 1909) discusses the relation of <i>Olaf Liljekrans</i> to the
      earlier form of the play. Three years intervened between the first and
      final versions of <i>The Warrior's Barrow</i>. Professor A. M. Sturtevant
      maintains (<i>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</i>, XII, 407 ff.)
      that although "the influence of Ochlenschlaeger upon both versions of <i>The
      Warrior's Barrow</i> is unmistakable," yet "the two versions differ so
      widely from each other ... that it may be assumed that ... Ibsen had begun
      to free himself from the thraldom of Ochlenschlaeger's romantic conception
      of the viking character." He points out the influence of Welhaven and
      Heiberg on the second version, elaborates upon the superior
      character-delineation, and shows in considerable detail the "inner
      necessity ... which brings about the change of heart in Gandalf and his
      warriors."
    </p>
    <p>
      The revision of <i>Catiline</i> came twenty-five years after the original
      version, and consisted largely of linguistic changes. Ibsen seems never to
      have completely disowned this play; it has been included in all the
      complete editions, whereas <i>The Warrior's Barrow</i> and <i>Olaf
      Liljekrans</i> appear only in the first complete edition, and were even
      then relegated to a supplementary volume. In suggesting the revision of <i>Catiline</i>,
      Ibsen proposed "to make no change in the thought and ideas, but only in
      the language in which these are expressed; for the verses are, as Brandes
      has somewhere remarked, bad,&mdash;one reason being that the book was
      printed from my first rough uncorrected draft." He had at that time not
      developed his careful craftsmanship, and sought in the revision merely to
      put the drama into the form which he had originally had in mind, but which
      at that time he had been unable to achieve. The changes that were actually
      made are summarized by D. A. Seip (Ibsen, <i>Samlede Digter Verker</i>,
      1918, VII, 114) who quotes Halvdan Koht and Julius Elias (Ibsen, <i>Efterladte
      Skrifter</i>, III): "The two editions 'agree in the sequence of tenses,
      with a few exceptions also in the sequence of speeches, and on the whole
      even in the sequence of lines. The changes involve principally the poetic
      expression itself; after the second act they become more and more
      extensive, and the last two acts have been augmented with 100 lines.' ...
      Not infrequently there appear words and expressions which are suggestive
      of Ibsen's later works."
    </p>
    <p>
      These plays now appear for the first time in English translation. A.
      Johnstone published in <i>Translations from the Norse, by a B. S. S.</i>
      (Gloucester, about 1876), an English rendering of the first act of <i>Catiline</i>
      and a synopsis of the last two acts. William Archer explains at length his
      omission of <i>Catiline</i> from his edition of Ibsen. "A great part of
      the interest lies in the very crudities of its style, which it would be a
      thankless task to reproduce in translation. Moreover, the poet impaired
      even its biographical value by largely rewriting it before publication. He
      did not make it, or attempt to make it, a better play, but he in some
      measure corrected its juvenility of expression. Which version, then,
      should a translator choose? To go back to the original would seem a
      deliberate disregard of the poet's wishes; while, on the other hand, the
      retouched version is clearly of far inferior interest. It seems advisable,
      therefore, to leave the play alone, as far as this edition is concerned."
      <i>Olaf Liljekrans</i> and <i>The Warrior's Barrow</i> were acted in
      English in London in 1911 and 1912 respectively, but the English
      renderings used in these presentations have never appeared in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text of <i>Catiline</i> in the present translation is that of the
      revised version as given in the edition of 1906-07; the text of the other
      two plays is that of the edition of 1898-1902. The meters of the original
      have been carefully reproduced. The great difficulty of rendering the
      ballad and lyrical meters of Ibsen into adequate English verse has made
      some stylistic changes necessary, such as the substitution of masculine
      for feminine rhymes, and the occasional alteration of the sense in slight
      measure.

    <p>
      I take this opportunity to acknowledge my gratitude to Professor O. W.
      Firkins, now of <i>The Weekly Review</i>, who suggested the translating of
      these plays and who offered from time to time invaluable criticisms; to
      Professor Howard M. Jones, of the University of Texas, Professor S. B.
      Hustvedt, of the University of Minnesota, and Professor W. W. Lawrence, of
      Columbia University, who read all or parts of these translations and made
      many helpful suggestions; and to Professor G. P. Krapp, of Columbia
      University, and my wife, who were of assistance in various ways.

      PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The drama <i>Catiline</i>, with which I entered upon my literary career,
      was written during the winter of 1848-49, that is in my twenty-first year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was at the time in Grimstad, under the necessity of earning with my
      hands the wherewithal of life and the means for instruction preparatory to
      my taking the entrance examinations to the university. The age was one of
      great stress. The February revolution, the uprisings in Hungary and
      elsewhere, the Slesvig war,&mdash;all this had a great effect upon and
      hastened my development, however immature it may have remained for some
      time after. I wrote ringing poems of encouragement to the Magyars, urging
      them for the sake of liberty and humanity to hold out in the righteous
      struggle against the "tyrants"; I wrote a long series of sonnets to King
      Oscar, containing particularly, as far as I can remember, an appeal to set
      aside all petty considerations and to march forthwith at the head of his
      army to the aid of our brothers on the outermost borders of Slesvig.
      Inasmuch as I now, in contrast to those times, doubt that my winged
      appeals would in any material degree have helped the cause of the Magyars
      or the Scandinavians, I consider it fortunate that they remained within
      the more private sphere of the manuscript. I could not, however, on more
      formal occasions keep from expressing myself in the impassioned spirit of
      my poetic effusions, which meanwhile brought me nothing&mdash;from friends
      or non-friends&mdash;but a questionable reward; the former greeted me as
      peculiarly fitted for the unintentionally droll, and the latter thought it
      in the highest degree strange that a young person in my subordinate
      position could undertake to inquire into affairs concerning which not even
      they themselves dared to entertain an opinion. I owe it to truth to add
      that my conduct at various times did not justify any great hope that
      society might count on an increase in me of civic virtue, inasmuch as I
      also, with epigrams and caricatures, fell out with many who had deserved
      better of me and whose friendship I in reality prized. Altogether,&mdash;while
      a great struggle raged on the outside, I found myself on a war-footing
      with the little society where I lived cramped by conditions and
      circumstances of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the situation when amid the preparations for my examinations I
      read through Sallust's <i>Catiline</i> together with Cicero's Catilinarian
      orations. I swallowed these documents, and a few months later my drama was
      complete. As will be seen from my book, I did not share at that time the
      conception of the two ancient Roman writers respecting the character and
      conduct of Catiline, and I am even now prone to believe that there must
      after all have been something great and consequential in a man whom
      Cicero, the assiduous counsel of the majority, did not find it expedient
      to engage until affairs had taken such a turn that there was no longer any
      danger involved in the attack. It should also be remembered that there are
      few individuals in history whose renown has been more completely in the
      hands of enemies than that of Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      My drama was written during the hours of the night. The leisure hours for
      my study I practically had to steal from my employer, a good and
      respectable man, occupied however heart and soul with his business, and
      from those stolen study hours I again stole moments for writing verse.
      There was consequently scarcely anything else to resort to but the night.
      I believe this is the unconscious reason that almost the entire action of
      the piece transpires at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally a fact so incomprehensible to my associates as that I busied
      myself with the writing of plays had to be kept secret; but a twenty-year
      old poet can hardly continue thus without anybody being privy to it, and I
      confided therefore to two friends of my own age what I was secretly
      engaged upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three of us pinned great expectations on <i>Catiline</i> when it had
      been completed. First and foremost it was now to be copied in order to be
      submitted under an assumed name to the theater in Christiania, and
      furthermore it was of course to be published. One of my faithful and
      trusting friends undertook to prepare a handsome and legible copy of my
      uncorrected draft, a task which he performed with such a degree of
      conscientiousness that he did not omit even a single one of the
      innumerable dashes which I in the heat of composition had liberally
      interspersed throughout wherever the exact phrase did not for the moment
      occur to me. The second of my friends, whose name I here mention since he
      is no longer among the living, Ole C. Schulerud, at that time a student,
      later a lawyer, went to Christiania with the transcript. I still remember
      one of his letters in which he informed me that <i>Catiline</i> had now
      been submitted to the theater; that it would soon be given a performance,&mdash;about
      that there could naturally be no doubt inasmuch as the management
      consisted of very discriminating men; and that there could be as little
      doubt that the booksellers of the town would one and all gladly pay a
      round fee for the first edition, the main point being, he thought, only to
      discover the one who would make the highest bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long and tense period of waiting there began to appear in the
      meantime a few difficulties. My friend had the piece returned from the
      management with a particularly polite but equally peremptory rejection. He
      now took the manuscript from bookseller to bookseller; but all to a man
      expressed themselves to the same effect as the theatrical management. The
      highest bidder demanded so and so much to publish the piece without any
      fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, however, was far from lessening my friend's belief in victory.
      He wrote to the contrary that it was best even so; I should come forward
      myself as the publisher of my drama; the necessary funds he would advance
      me; the profits we should divide in consideration of his undertaking the
      business end of the deal, except the proof-reading, which he regarded as
      superfluous in view of the handsome and legible manuscript the printers
      had to follow. In a later letter he declared that, considering these
      promising prospects for the future, he contemplated abandoning his studies
      in order to consecrate himself completely to the publishing of my works;
      two or three plays a year, he thought, I should with ease be able to
      write, and according to a calculation of probabilities he had made he had
      discovered that with our surplus we should at no distant time be able to
      undertake the journey so often agreed upon or discussed, through Europe
      and the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey was for the time being limited to Christiania. I arrived there
      in the beginning of the spring of 1850 and just previous to my arrival <i>Catiline</i>
      had appeared in the bookstalls. The drama created a stir and awakened
      considerable interest among the students, but the critics dwelt largely on
      the faulty verses and thought the book in other respects immature. A more
      appreciative judgment was uttered from but one single quarter, but this
      expression came from a man whose appreciation has always been dear to me
      and weighty and whom I herewith offer my renewed gratitude. Not very many
      copies of the limited edition were sold; my friend had a good share of
      them in his custody, and I remember that one evening when our domestic
      arrangements heaped up for us insurmountable difficulties, this pile of
      printed matter was fortunately disposed of as waste paper to a huckster.
      During the days immediately following we lacked none of the prime
      necessities of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my sojourn at home last summer and particularly since my return
      here there loomed up before me more clearly and more sharply than ever
      before the kaleidoscopic scenes of my literary life. Among other things I
      also brought out <i>Catiline</i>. The contents of the book as regards
      details I had almost forgotten; but by reading it through anew I found
      that it nevertheless contained a great deal which I could still
      acknowledge, particularly if it be remembered that it is my first
      undertaking. Much, around which my later writings center, the
      contradiction between ability and desire, between will and possibility,
      the intermingled tragedy and comedy in humanity and in the individual,&mdash;appeared
      already here in vague foreshadowings, and I conceived therefore the plan
      of preparing a new edition, a kind of jubilee-edition,&mdash;a plan to
      which my publisher with his usual readiness gave his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was naturally not enough simply to reprint without further ado the
      old original edition, for this is, as already pointed out, nothing but a
      copy of my imperfect and uncorrected concept or of the very first rough
      draft. In the rereading of it I remembered clearly what I originally had
      had in mind, and I saw moreover that the form practically nowhere gave a
      satisfactory rendering of what I had wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined therefore to revise this drama of my youth in a way in which
      I believe even at that time I should have been able to do it had the time
      been at my disposal and the circumstances more favorable for me. The
      ideas, the conceptions, and the development of the whole, I have not on
      the other hand altered. The book has remained the original; only now it
      appears in a complete form.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind I pray that my friends in Scandinavia and elsewhere will
      receive it; I pray that they will receive it as a greeting from me at the
      close of a period which to me has been full of changes and rich in
      contradictions. Much of what I twenty-five years ago dreamed has been
      realized, even though not in the manner nor as soon as I then hoped. Yet I
      believe now that it was best for me thus; I do not wish that any of that
      which lies between should have been untried, and if I look back upon what
      I have lived through I do so with thanks for everything and thanks to all.

      FIRST ACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [The Flaminian Way outside of Rome. Off the road a wooded hillside. In the
      background loom the walls and the heights of the city. It is evening.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE stands on the hill among the bushes, leaning against a tree.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  CATILINE.  I must!  I must!  A voice deep in my soul
  Urges me on,&mdash;and I will heed its call.
  Courage I have and strength for something better,
  Something far nobler than this present life,&mdash;
  A series of unbridled dissipations&mdash;!
  No, no; they do not satisfy the yearning soul.

  CATILINE.  I rave and rave,&mdash;long only to forget.
  'Tis past now,&mdash;all is past!  Life has no aim.

  CATILINE.  [After a pause.]
  And what became of all my youthful dreams?
  Like flitting summer clouds they disappeared,
  Left naught behind but sorrow and remorse;&mdash;
  Each daring hope in turn fate robbed me of.

  [He strikes his forehead.]

  CATILINE.  Despise yourself!  Catiline, scorn yourself!
  You feel exalted powers in your soul;&mdash;
  And yet what is the goal of all your struggle?
  The surfeiting of sensual desires.

  CATILINE.  [More calmly.]
  But there are times, such as the present hour,
  When secret longings kindle in my breast.
  Ah, when I gaze on yonder city, Rome,
  The proud, the rich,&mdash;and when I see that ruin
  And wretchedness to which it now is sunk
  Loom up before me like the flaming sun,&mdash;
  Then loudly calls a voice within my soul:
  Up, Catiline;&mdash;awake and be a man!

  CATILINE.  [Abruptly.]  Ah, these are but delusions of the night,
  Mere dreaming phantoms born of solitude.
  At the slightest sound from grim reality,&mdash;
  They flee into the silent depths within.

  [The ambassadors of the Allobroges, AMBIORIX and OLLOVICO, with
  their Escort, come down the highway without noticing CATILINE.]

  AMBIORIX.  Behold our journey's end!  The walls of Rome!
  To heaven aspires the lofty Capitol.

  OLLOVICO.  So that is Rome?  Italy's overlord,
  Germany's soon,&mdash;and Gaul's as well, perchance.

  AMBIORIX.  Ah, yes, alas;&mdash;so it may prove betimes;
  The sovereign power of Rome is merciless;
  It crushes all it conquers, down to earth.
  Now shall we see what lot we may expect:
  If here be help against the wrongs at home,
  And peace and justice for our native land.

  OLLOVICO.  It will be granted us.

  AMBIORIX.  So let us hope;
  For we know nothing yet with certainty.

  OLLOVICO.  You fear somewhat, it seems?

  AMBIORIX.  And with good reason.
  Jealous was ever Rome of her great power.
  And bear in mind, this proud and haughty realm
  Is not by chieftains ruled, as is our land.
  At home the wise man or the warrior reigns,&mdash;
  The first in wisdom and in war the foremost;
  Him choose we as the leader of our people,
  As arbiter and ruler of our tribe.
  But here&mdash;

  CATILINE.  [Calls down to them.]
  &mdash;Here might and selfishness hold sway;&mdash;
  Intrigue and craft are here the keys to power.

  OLLOVICO.  Woe to us, brethren, woe!  He spies upon us.

  AMBIORIX.  [To CATILINE.]
  Is such the practice of the high-born Roman?
  A woman's trick we hold it in our nation.

  CATILINE.  [comes down on the road.]
  Ah, have no fear;&mdash;spying is not my business;
  By chance it was I heard your conversation.&mdash;
  Come you from Allobrogia far away?
  Justice you think to find in Rome?  Ah, never!
  Turn home again!  Here tyranny holds sway,
  And rank injustice lords it more than ever.
  Republic to be sure it is in name;
  And yet all men are slaves who cringe and cower,
  Vassals involved in debt, who must acclaim
  A venal senate&mdash;ruled by greed and power.
  Gone is the social consciousness of old,
  The magnanimity of former ages;&mdash;
  Security and life are favors sold,
  Which must be bargained for with hire and wages.
  Not righteousness, but power here holds sway;
  The noble man is lost among the gilded&mdash;

  AMBIORIX.  But say,&mdash;who then are you to tear away
  The pillars of the hope on which we builded?

  CATILINE.  A man who burns in freedom's holy zeal;
  An enemy of all unrighteous power;
  Friend of the helpless trodden under heel,&mdash;
  Eager to hurl the mighty from their tower.

  AMBIORIX.  The noble race of Rome&mdash;?  Ah, Roman, speak&mdash;
  Since we are strangers here you would deceive us?
  Is Rome no more the guardian of the weak,
  The dread of tyrants,&mdash;ready to relieve us?

  CATILINE.  [Points towards the city and speaks.]
  Behold the mighty Capitol that towers
  On yonder heights in haughty majesty.
  See, in the glow of evening how it lowers,
  Tinged with the last rays of the western sky.&mdash;
  So too Rome's evening glow is fast declining,
  Her freedom now is thraldom, dark as night.&mdash;
  Yet in her sky a sun will soon be shining,
  Before which darkness quick will take its flight.

  [He goes.]

      conversation.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Yes, you are right; things go from bad to worse; And what the
      end will be I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Bah! I am not concerned about the end. The fleeting moment I
      enjoy; each cup Of pleasure as it comes I empty,&mdash;letting All else go
      on to ruin as it will.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Happy is he who can. I am not blessed With your indifference,
      that can outface The day when nothing shall be left us more, Nothing with
      which to pay the final score.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. And not the faintest glimpse of better things! Yet it is true:
      a mode of life like ours&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Enough of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Today because of debt The last of my inheritance was seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Enough of sorrow and complaint! Come, friends! We'll drown them
      in a merry drinking bout!
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Yes, let us drink. Come, come, my merry comrades!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. A moment, friends; I see old Manlius yonder,&mdash; Seeking us
      out, I think, as is his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. [Enters impetuously.] Confound the shabby dogs, the paltry
      scoundrels! Justice and fairness they no longer know!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Come, what has happened? Wherefore so embittered?
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Have usurers been plaguing you as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Something quite different. As you all know, I served with honor
      among Sulla's troops; A bit of meadow land was my reward. And when the war
      was at an end, I lived Thereon; it furnished me my daily bread. Now is it
      taken from me! Laws decree&mdash; State property shall to the state revert
      For equal distribution. Theft, I say,&mdash; It is rank robbery and
      nothing else! Their greed is all they seek to satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Thus with our rights they sport to please themselves. The
      mighty always dare do what they will.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. [Gaily.] Hard luck for Manlius! Yet, a worse mishap Has come to
      me, as I shall now relate. Listen,&mdash;you know my pretty mistress,
      Livia,&mdash; The little wretch has broken faith with me, Just now when I
      had squandered for her sake The slender wealth that still remained to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Extravagance&mdash;the cause of your undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Well, as you please; but I will not forego My own desires;
      these, while the day is fair, To their full measure I will satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. And I who fought so bravely for the glory And might which now the
      vaunting tyrants boast! I shall&mdash;! If but the brave old band were
      here, My comrades of the battlefield! But no; The greater part of them,
      alas, is dead; The rest live scattering in many lands.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Oh, what are you, the younger blood, to them? You bend and cringe
      before authority; You dare not break the chains that bind you fast; You
      suffer patiently this life of bondage!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. By all the Gods,&mdash;although indeed he taunts us, Yet,
      Romans, is there truth in what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Oh, well,&mdash;what of it? He is right, we grant, But where
      shall we begin? Ay, there's the rub.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Yes, it is true. Too long have we endured This great oppression.
      Now&mdash;now is the time To break the bonds asunder that injustice And
      vain ambition have about us forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Ah, Lentulus, I understand. Yet hold; For such a thing we need
      a mighty leader,&mdash; With pluck and vision. Where can he be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. I know a man who has the power to lead us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Ah, you mean Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. The very man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Yes, Catiline perchance is just the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. I know him well. I was his father's friend; Many a battle side by
      side we fought. Often his young son went with him to war. Even his early
      years were wild and headstrong; Yet he gave open proof of rare endowments,&mdash;
      His mind was noble, dauntless was his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. We'll find him, as I think, most prompt and willing. I met him
      late this evening much depressed; He meditates in secret some bold plan;&mdash;
      Some desperate scheme he long has had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. No doubt; the consulate he long has sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. His efforts are in vain; his enemies Have madly raged against
      him in the senate;&mdash; He was himself among them; full of wrath He left
      the council&mdash;brooding on revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Then will he surely welcome our proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. I hope so. Yet must we in secret weigh Our enterprise. The time
      is opportune.

      lamp with the sacred fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE, followed by CURIUS, comes stealing in between the pillars.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. What, Catiline,&mdash;you mean to bring me here? In Vesta's
      temple!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Laughing.] Well, yes; so you see!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Ye gods,&mdash;what folly! On this very day Has Cicero denounced
      you in the council; And yet you dare&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, let that be forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. You are in danger, and forget it thus&mdash; By rushing blindly
      into some new peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Gaily.] Well, change is my delight. I never knew Ere now a
      vestal's love,&mdash;forbidden fruit;&mdash; Wherefore I came to try my
      fortune here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. What,&mdash;here, you say? Impossible! A jest!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. A jest? Why, yes,&mdash;as all my loving is. And yet I was in
      earnest when I spoke. During the recent games I chanced to see The
      priestesses in long and pompous train. By accident I cast my roving eye On
      one of them,&mdash;and with a hasty glance She met my gaze. It pierced me
      to the soul. Ah, the expression in those midnight eyes I never saw before
      in any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Yes, yes, I know. But speak&mdash;what followed then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. A way into the temple I have found, And more than once I've seen
      and spoken to her. Oh, what a difference between this woman And my
      Aurelia!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. And you love them both At once? No,&mdash;that I cannot
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, strange, indeed; I scarcely understand myself. And yet&mdash;I
      love them both, as you have said. But oh, how vastly different is this
      love! The one is kind: Aurelia often lulls With soothing words my soul to
      peace and rest;&mdash; But Furia&mdash;. Come, away; some one approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They hide themselves among the pillars.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Enters from the opposite side.] Oh, hated walls,&mdash;witnesses
      of my anguish. Home of the torment I must suffer still! My hopes and
      cherished aspirations languish Within my bosom,&mdash;now with feverish
      chill Pervaded, now with all the heat of passion, More hot and burning
      than yon vestal fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ah, what a fate! And what was my transgression That chained me to
      this temple-prison dire,&mdash; That robbed my life of every youthful
      pleasure,&mdash; In life's warm spring each innocent delight?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Yet tears I shall not shed in undue measure; Hatred and vengeance
      shall my heart excite.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Comes forward.] Not even for me, my Furia, do you cherish
      Another feeling,&mdash;one more mild than this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ye gods! you, reckless man,&mdash;you here again? Do you not fear
      to come&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I know no fear. 'Twas always my delight to mock at danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Oh, splendid! Such is also my delight;&mdash; This peaceful temple
      here I hate the more, Because I live in everlasting calm, And danger never
      lurks within its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Oh, this monotonous, inactive life, A life faint as the flicker of
      the lamp&mdash;! How cramped a field it is for all my sum Of fervid
      longings and far-reaching plans! Oh, to be crushed between these narrow
      walls;&mdash; Life here grows stagnant; every hope is quenched; The day
      creeps slowly on in drowsiness,&mdash; And not one single thought is
      turned to deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. O Furia, strange, in truth, is your complaint! It seems an echo
      out of my own soul,&mdash; As if with flaming script you sought to paint
      My every longing towards a worthy goal. Rancour and hate in my soul
      likewise flourish; My heart&mdash;as yours&mdash;hate tempers into steel;
      I too was robbed of hopes I used to nourish; An aim in life I now no
      longer feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. In silence still I mask my grief, my want; And none can guess
      what smoulders in my breast. They scoff and sneer at me,&mdash;these
      paltry things; They can not grasp how high my bosom beats For right and
      freedom, all the noble thoughts That ever stirred within a Roman mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I knew it! Ah, your soul, and yours alone, Is born for me,&mdash;thus
      clearly speaks a voice That never fails and never plays me false. Then
      come! Oh, come&mdash;and let us heed the call.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What do you mean, my sweet enthusiast?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Come,&mdash;let us leave this place, flee far away, And seek a new
      and better fatherland. Here is the spirit's lofty pride repressed; Here
      baseness smothers each auspicious spark Ere it can break into a burning
      flame. Come, let us fly;&mdash;lo, to the free-born mind The world's wide
      compass is a fatherland!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, irresistibly you lure me on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Come, let us use the present moment then! High o'er the hills,
      beyond the sea's expanse,&mdash; Far, far from Rome we first will stay our
      journey. Thousands of friends will follow you outright; In foreign lands
      we shall a home design; There shall we rule; 'twill there be brought to
      light That no hearts ever beat as yours and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, wonderful!&mdash;But flee? Why must we flee? Here too our
      love for freedom can be nourished; Here also is a field for thought and
      action, As vast as any that your soul desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Here, do you say? Here, in this paltry Rome, Where naught exists
      but thraldom and oppression? Ah, Lucius, are you likewise one of those Who
      can Rome's past recall without confession Of shame? Who ruled here then?
      Who rule to-day? Then an heroic race&mdash;and now a rabble, The slaves of
      other slaves&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Mock me you may;&mdash; Yet know,&mdash;to save Rome's freedom
      from this babble, To see yet once again her vanished splendor, Gladly I
      should, like Curtius, throw myself Into the abyss&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I trust you, you alone; Your eyes glow bright; I know you speak the
      truth. Yet go; the priestesses will soon appear; Their wont it is to meet
      here at this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I go; but only to return again. A magic power binds me to your
      side;&mdash; So proud a woman have I never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [With a wild smile.] Then pledge me this; and swear that you will
      keep Whatever you may promise. Will you, Lucius?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I will do aught my Furia may require; Command me,&mdash;tell me
      what am I to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Then listen. Though I dwell a captive here, I know there lives a
      man somewhere in Rome Whom I have sworn deep enmity to death&mdash; And
      hatred even beyond the gloomy grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. And then&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Then swear, my enemy shall be Your enemy till death. Will you, my
      Lucius?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I swear it here by all the mighty gods! I swear it by my
      father's honored name And by my mother's memory&mdash;! But, Furia,&mdash;
      What troubles you? Your eyes are wildly flaming,&mdash; And white as
      marble, deathlike, are your cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I do not know myself. A fiery stream Flows through my veins. Swear
      to the end your oath!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, mighty powers, pour out upon this head Your boundless fury,
      let your lightning wrath Annihilate me, if I break my oath; Aye, like a
      demon I shall follow him!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Enough! I trust you. Ah, my heart is eased. In your hand now indeed
      rests my revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. It shall be carried out. But tell me this,&mdash; Who is your
      foe? And what was his transgression?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Close by the Tiber, far from the city's tumult, My cradle stood; it
      was a quiet home! A sister much beloved lived with me there, A chosen
      vestal from her childhood days.&mdash; Then came a coward to our distant
      valley;&mdash; He saw the fair, young priestess of the future&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Surprised.] A priestess? Tell me&mdash;! Speak&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. He ravished her. She sought a grave beneath the Tiber's stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Uneasy.] You know him?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I have never seen the man. When first I heard the tidings, all was
      past. His name is all I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then speak it out!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now is it famed. His name is Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Taken aback.] What do you say? Oh, horrors! Furia, speak&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Calm yourself! What perturbs you? You grow pale. My Lucius,&mdash;is
      this man perhaps your friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. My friend? Ah, Furia, no;&mdash;no longer now. For I have
      cursed,&mdash;and sworn eternal hate Against myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. You&mdash;you are Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, I am he.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. My Sylvia you disgraced? Nemesis then indeed has heard my prayer;&mdash;
      Vengeance you have invoked on your own head! Woe on you, man of violence!
      Woe!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. How blank The stare is in your eye. Like Sylvia's shade You seem
      to me in this dim candle light.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He rushes out; the lamp with the sacred fire goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [After a pause.] Yes, now I understand it. From my eyes The veil is
      fallen,&mdash;in the dark I see. Hatred it was that settled in my breast,
      When first I spied him in the market-place. A strange emotion; like a
      crimson flame! Ah, he shall know what such a hate as mine, Constantly
      brewing, never satisfied, Can fashion out in ruin and revenge!
    </p>
    <p>
      A VESTAL. [Enters.] Go, Furia, go; your watch is at an end; Therefore I
      came&mdash;. Yet, sacred goddess, here&mdash; Woe unto you! The vestal
      fire is dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Bewildered.] Dead, did you say? So bright it never burned;&mdash;
      'Twill never, never die!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VESTAL. Great heavens,&mdash;what is this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. The fires of hate are not thus lightly quenched! Behold, love
      bursts forth of a sudden,&mdash;dies Within the hour; but hate&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VESTAL. By all the gods,&mdash; This is sheer madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Calls out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VESTAL. Come! Oh, help! Come, help!
    </p>
    <p>
      [VESTALS and temple SERVANTS rush in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. What is amiss?
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. The vestal fire is dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. But hate burns on; revenge still blazes high!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VESTALS. Away with her to trial and punishment!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They carry her out between them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Comes forward.] To prison now they take her. Thence to death.&mdash;
      No, no, by all the gods, this shall not be! Must she, most glorious of
      womankind, Thus perish in disgrace, entombed alive?&mdash; Oh, never have
      I felt so strangely moved. Is this then love? Yes, love it is indeed.&mdash;
      Then shall I set her free!&mdash;But Catiline? With hate and vengeance
      will she follow him. Has he maligners not enough already? Dare I still
      others to their number add? He was to me as were an elder brother; And
      gratitude now bids me that I shield him.&mdash; But what of love? Ah, what
      does it command? And should he quake, the fearless Catiline, Before the
      intrigues of a woman? No;&mdash; Then to the rescue work this very hour!
      Wait, Furia;&mdash;I shall drag you from your grave To life again,&mdash;though
      at the risk of death!

    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Enters impetuous and uneasy.] "Nemesis then indeed has heard my
      prayer, Vengeance you have invoked on your own head!" Such were the words
      from the enchantress' lips. Remarkable! Perchance it was a sign,&mdash; A
      warning of what time will bring to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Now therefore I have pledged myself on oath The blood avenger of
      my own misdeed. Ah, Furia,&mdash;still I seem to see your eye, Wildly
      aflame like that of death's own goddess! Your words still echo hollow in
      my ears;&mdash; The oath I shall remember all my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      [During the following AURELIA enters and approaches him unnoticed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yet, it is folly now to go on brooding Upon this nonsense; it is
      nothing else. Far better things there are to think upon; A greater work
      awaits my energies. The restless age is urgent with its plea; Toward this
      I must direct my thought in season; Of hope and doubt I am a stormy sea&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Seizes his hand.] And may not your Aurelia know the reason? May
      she not know what moves within your breast, What stirs therein and rages
      with such madness? May she not cheer and soothe your soul to rest, And
      banish from your brow its cloud of sadness?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Tenderly.] O, my Aurelia,&mdash;O, how kind and tender&mdash;.
      Yet why should I embitter all your life? Why should I share with you my
      many sorrows? For my sake you have borne enough of anguish. Henceforth
      upon my own head I shall bear What ill-designing fate allotted me,&mdash;
      The curse that lies in such a soul as mine, Full of great spiritual
      energies, Of fervent longings for a life of deeds, Yet dwarfed in all its
      work by sordid cares.&mdash; Must you, too, sharing in my wretched life,
      Bitter with blasted hopes, then with me perish?
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. To comfort is the role of every wife, Though dreams of greatness
      she may never cherish. When the man, struggling for his lofty dream, Reaps
      nothing but adversity and sorrow,&mdash; Her words to him then sweet and
      tender seem, And give him strength sufficient for the morrow; And then he
      sees that even the quiet life Has pleasures which the most tumultuous
      lacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, you are right; I know it all too well. And yet I cannot
      tear myself away. A ceaseless yearning surges in my breast,&mdash; Which
      only life's great tumult now can quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Though your Aurelia be not all to you,&mdash; Though she can
      never still your restless soul,&mdash; Your heart yet open to a gentle
      word, A word of comfort from your loving wife. Though she may never slake
      your fiery thirst, Nor follow in their flight your noble thoughts,&mdash;
      Know this, that she can share your every sorrow, Has strength and
      fortitude to ease your burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then listen, dear Aurelia; you shall hear What has of late
      depressed so deep my spirits. You know, I long have sought the consulate&mdash;
      Without avail. You know the whole affair&mdash; How to increase the votes
      for my election, I have expended&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Catiline, no more; You torture me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Do you too blame my course? What better means therefor had I to
      choose?&mdash; In vain I lavished all that I possessed; My one reward was
      mockery and shame. Now in the senate has my adversary, The crafty Cicero,
      trampled me to earth. His speech was a portrayal of my life, So glaring
      that I, even I, must gasp. In every look I read dismay and fear; With
      loathing people speak of Catiline; To races yet unborn my name will be A
      symbol of a low and dreadful union Of sensuality and wretchedness, Of
      scorn and ridicule for what is noble.&mdash; And there will be no deed to
      purge this name And crush to earth the lies that have been told! Each will
      believe whatever rumor tells&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. But I, dear husband, trust no such reports. Let the whole world
      condemn you if it will; And let it heap disgrace upon your head;&mdash; I
      know you hide within your inmost soul A seed that still can blossom and
      bear fruit. Only it cannot burst forth here in Rome; Poisonous weeds would
      quickly prove the stronger. Let us forsake this degradation's home;&mdash;
      What binds you here? Why should we dwell here longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I should forsake the field,&mdash;and go away? I should my
      greatest dreams in life surrender? The drowning man still clutches firm
      and fast The broken spars&mdash;though hope is frail and slender; And
      should the wreck be swallowed in the deep, And the last hope of rescue
      fail forever,&mdash; Still clings he to the lone remaining spar, And sinks
      with it in one last vain endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. But should a kindly seacoast smile on him, With groves all green
      along the rolling billows, Hope then awakens in his heart again,&mdash; He
      struggles inward, toward the silvery willows. There reigns a quiet peace;
      'tis beautiful; There roll the waves, in silence, without number; His
      heated brow sweet evening breezes cool, As weary-limbed he rests himself
      in slumber; Each sorrow-laden cloud they drive away; A restful calm his
      weary mind assuages;&mdash; There he finds shelter and prolongs his stay
      And soon forgets the sorry by-gone ages. The distant echo of the world's
      unrest Alone can reach his dwelling unfrequented. It does not break the
      calm within his breast;&mdash; It makes his soul more happy and contented;
      It calls to mind the by-gone time of strife, Its shattered hopes and its
      unbridled pleasures; He finds twice beautiful this quiet life&mdash; And
      would not change it for the greatest treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You speak the truth; and in this very hour From strife and
      tumult I could go with you. But can you name me some such quiet spot,
      Where we can live in shelter and in peace?
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Joyful.] You will go, Catiline? What happiness,&mdash; Oh,
      richer than my bosom can contain! Let it be so, then! Come! This very
      night We'll go away&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. But whither shall we go? Name me the spot where I may dare to
      rest My head in homely peace!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. How can you ask? Have you forgot our villa in the country,
      Wherein I passed my childhood days, where since, Enraptured during love's
      first happy dawn, We two spent many a blithesome summer day? Where was the
      grass indeed so green as there? Where else the groves so shady and
      sweet-smelling? The snow-white villa from its wooded lair Peeps forth and
      bids us there to make our dwelling. There let us flee and dedicate our
      life To rural duties and to sweet contentment;&mdash; You will find
      comfort in a loving wife, And through her kisses banish all resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. And when with all the flowers of the land You come to me, your
      sovereign, in my bowers, Then shall I crown you with the laurel band, And
      cry, All hail to you, my king of flowers!&mdash; But why do you grow pale?
      Wildly you press My hand,&mdash;and strangely now your eyes are glowing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Aurelia, alas, past is your happiness;&mdash; There we can
      never, never think of going. There we can never go!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. You frighten me! Yet, surely,&mdash;you are jesting, Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I jest! Would only that it were a jest! Each word you speak,
      like the avenging dart Of Nemesis, pierces my heavy heart, Which fate will
      never grant a moment's rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. O gods! speak, speak! What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. See here! Here is your villa,&mdash;here your future joys!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He draws out a purse filled with gold and throws it on the table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Oh, you have sold&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes,&mdash;all I sold today;&mdash; And to what end? In order to
      corrupt&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. O Catiline, no more! Let us not think On this affair; sorrow is
      all it brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Your quiet-patience wounds me tenfold more Than would a cry of
      anguish from your lips!
    </p>
    <p>
      [An old SOLDIER enters and approaches CATILINE.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SOLDIER. Forgive me, master, that thus unannounced I enter your abode
      at this late hour. Ah, be not wroth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What is your errand here?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SOLDIER. My errand here is but a humble prayer, Which you will hear. I
      am a needy man, One who has sacrificed his strength for Rome. Now I am
      feeble, can no longer serve; Unused my weapons rust away at home. The hope
      of my old age was in a son, Who labored hard and was my one support. Alas,&mdash;in
      prison now he's held for debt. And not a ray of hope&mdash;. Oh, help me,
      master!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Kneeling.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SOLDIER. If but a penny! I have gone on foot From house to house; each
      door is long since closed. I know not what to do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. The paltry knaves! A picture this is of the many's want. Thus
      they reward the old brave company. No longer gratitude is found in Rome!
      Time was I might have wished in righteous wrath To punish them with sword
      and crimson flames; But tender words have just been spoken here; My soul
      is moved; I do not wish to punish;&mdash; To ease misfortune likewise is a
      deed.&mdash; Take this, old warrior;&mdash;clear with this your debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He hands him the purse with the gold.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SOLDIER. [Rising.] O gracious lord,&mdash;dare I believe your words?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes; but be quick, old man; go free your son.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The SOLDIER goes hurriedly out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. A better use,&mdash;not so, Aurelia dear?&mdash; Than bribery
      and purchasing of votes? Noble it is to crush the tyrant's might; Yet
      quiet solace too has its reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Throws herself in his arms.] Oh, rich and noble is your spirit
      still. Yes,&mdash;now I know my Catiline again.

    <p>
      [FURIA, in long black robes, is standing in the tomb as if listening.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. A hollow sound. 'Tis thunder rolls above. I hear its rumble even in
      the tomb. Yet is the tomb itself so still&mdash;so still! Am I forever
      damned to drowsy rest? Never again am I to wander forth By winding paths,
      as ever was my wish?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [After a pause.] A strange, strange life it was;&mdash;as strange a
      fate. Meteor-like all came&mdash;and disappeared. He met me. A mysterious
      magic force, An inner harmony, together drew us. I was his Nemesis;&mdash;and
      he my victim;&mdash; Yet punishment soon followed the avenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Another pause.] Now daylight rules the earth.&mdash;Am I perchance
      To slip&mdash;unknowing&mdash;from the realm of light? 'Tis well, if so it
      be,&mdash;if this delay Within the tomb be nothing but a flight Upon the
      wings of lightning into Hades,&mdash; If I be nearing even now the Styx!
      There roll the leaden billows on the shore; There silently old Charon
      plies his boat. Soon am I there! Then shall I seat myself Beside the
      ferry,&mdash;question every spirit, Each fleeting shadow from the land of
      life, As light of foot he nears the river of death,&mdash; Shall ask each
      one in turn how Catiline Fares now among the mortals of the earth,&mdash;
      Shall ask each one how he has kept his oath. I shall illumine with blue
      sulphur light Each spectral countenance and hollow eye,&mdash; To
      ascertain if it be Catiline. And when he comes, then shall I follow him;&mdash;
      Together we shall make the journey hence, Together enter Pluto's silent
      hall. I too a shadow shall his shade pursue;&mdash; Where Catiline is,
      must Furia also be!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [After a pause, more faintly.] The air is growing close and clammy
      here,&mdash; And every breath in turn more difficult.&mdash; Thus am I
      drawing near the gloomy swamps, Where creep the rivers of the underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [She listens; a dull noise is heard.] A muffled sound? 'Tis like
      the stroke of oars. It is the ferryman of shades who comes To take me
      hence. No, here&mdash;here will I wait!
    </p>
    <p>

      SECOND ACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [A room in CATILINE's house with a colonnade in the rear; a lamp lights up
      the room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE paces the floor back and forth; LENTULUS and CETHEGUS are with
      him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, no! I say, you do not understand Yourselves what you demand
      of me. Should I Turn traitor and incite a civil war,&mdash; Besmear my
      hand with Roman blood? No, no! I'll never do it! Let the entire state
      Condemn me if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. You will not, Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Tell me,&mdash;have you nothing to avenge? No insult? No one
      here you fain would strike?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Let him who will avenge; I shall not stir. Yet silent scorn is
      likewise a revenge;&mdash; And that alone shall be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Aha,&mdash; Our visit was, I see, inopportune. Yet doubtless
      will the morrow bring you back To other thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. But why the morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. There are mysterious rumors in the air. A vestal recently was
      led to death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Surprised.] A vestal,&mdash;say you? Ah, what do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Why, yes, a vestal. Many people murmur&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What do they murmur?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. That in this dark affair You are not altogether innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. This they believe of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Such is the rumor; Of course,&mdash;to us, to all your good old
      friends, Such talk is trifling and of no account;&mdash; The world,
      however, judges more severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Deep in thought.] And is she dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Undoubtedly she is. An hour's confinement in the convict tomb Is
      quite enough&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. That is not our affair. It was not therefore that we spoke of
      her. But hear me, Catiline! Bethink yourself. You sought the consulate;
      and all your welfare Hung on that single fragile thread of hope. Now is it
      sundered; everything is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Still deep in thought.] "Vengeance you have invoked on your own
      head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Shake off these useless thoughts; they profit naught; Act like a
      man; still can this fight be won; A bold resolve now&mdash;; you have
      friends enough; Speak but the word, and we shall follow you.&mdash; You
      are not tempted? Answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, I say! And why are you so eager to conspire? Be honest! Are
      you driven by thirst for freedom? Is it in order to renew Rome's splendor
      That you would ruin all?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Indeed, 'tis not; Yet surely is the hope of personal greatness
      Sufficient motive for our enterprise!
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. And means enough to taste the joys of life Are not, in truth, to
      be so lightly scorned. That is my motive;&mdash;I am not ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I knew it. Only mean and paltry motives, The hope of private
      vantage, urge you on. No, no, my friends; I aimed at nobler things! True,
      I have sought with bribes and promises To seize ere now the consulate, and
      yet My plan was greater and comprised much more Than means like these
      would point to. Civic freedom, The welfare of the state,&mdash;these were
      my aims. Men have misjudged, appearances belied me; My fate has willed it
      so. It must so be!
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. True; but the thought of all your many friends Whom you can save
      from ruin and disgrace&mdash;? You know, we shall ere long be driven to
      take The beggars' staff because of our wild living.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then stop in season; that is my resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. What, Catiline,&mdash;now you intend to change Your mode of
      life? Ha, ha! you surely jest?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I am in earnest,&mdash;by the mighty gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Then there is nothing we can do with him. Come, Lentulus, the
      others we'll inform What answer he has given. We shall find The merry
      company with Bibulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. With Bibulus? How many a merry night We have caroused at
      Bibulus' table! Now is the tempest of my wild life ended; Ere dawns the
      day I shall have left the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. What is all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. You mean to go away?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. This very night my wife and I together Shall bid farewell to
      Rome forevermore. In quiet Gaul we two shall found a home;&mdash; The land
      I cultivate shall nourish us.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. You will forsake the city, Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I will; I must! Disgrace here weighs me down. Courage I have to
      bear my poverty, But in each Roman face to read disdain And frank contempt&mdash;!
      No, no; that is too much! In Gaul I'll live in quiet solitude; There shall
      I soon forget my former self, Dull all my longings for the greater things,
      And as the vaguest dream recall the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Then fare you well; may fortune follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Remember us with kindness, Catiline, As we shall you remember!
      To our brothers We will relate this new and strange resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then give them all a brother's hearty greeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      [LENTULUS and CETHEGUS leave.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [AURELIA has entered from the side, hut-stops frightened at the sight of
      those who are leaving; when they are gone she approaches CATILINE.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Gently reprimanding.] Again these stormy comrades in your house?
      O Catiline&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. This was their final visit. I bade them all farewell. Now every
      bond Forevermore is broken that bound me fast And fettered me to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. I've gathered up Our bit of property. Not much perhaps;&mdash;
      Yet, Catiline, enough for our contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Engrossed in thought.] More than enough for me who squandered
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Oh, brood no more on things we can not change;&mdash; Forget what&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Happy he who could forget,&mdash; Who could the memory tear from
      out his soul, The many hopes, the goal of all desires. Ah, time is needed
      ere I reach that state; But I shall struggle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. I shall help you strive; You shall be comforted for all your
      loss. Yet we must leave as soon as possible. Here life calls to you with a
      tempter's voice. Is it not so,&mdash;we go this very night?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, yes,&mdash;we leave this very night, Aurelia!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. The little money left I've gathered up; And for the journey it
      will be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Good! I shall sell my sword and buy a spade. What value
      henceforth is a sword to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. You clear the land, and I shall till the soil. Around our home
      will grow in floral splendor A hedge of roses, sweet forget-me-nots, The
      silent tokens of a chastened soul, When as some youthful comrade you can
      greet Each memory recurrent of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. That time, Aurelia? Ah, beloved, I fear&mdash; That hour lies in
      a distant future's keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [In a milder tone.] But go, dear wife, and, while you may,
      repose. Soon after midnight we shall start our journey. The city then is
      lapped in deepest slumber, And none shall guess our hidden destination.
      The first glow in the morning sky shall find us Far&mdash;far away; there
      in the laurel grove We'll rest ourselves upon the velvet grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. A new life opens up before us both&mdash; Richer in happiness
      than this that's ended. Now will I go. An hour's quiet rest Will give me
      strength&mdash;. Good-night, my Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She embraces him and goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Gazes after her.] Now is she gone! And I&mdash;what a relief!
      Now can I cast away this wearisome Hypocrisy, this show of cheerfulness,
      Which least of all is found within my heart. She is my better spirit. She
      would grieve Were she to sense my doubt. I must dissemble. Yet shall I
      consecrate this silent hour To contemplation of my wasted life.&mdash;
      This lamp,&mdash;ah, it disturbs my very thoughts;&mdash; Dark it must be
      here,&mdash;dark as is my soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He puts out the light; the moon shines through the pillars in the rear.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Too light,&mdash;yes, still too light! And yet, no matter;&mdash;
      The pallid moonlight here does well befit The twilight and the gloom that
      shroud my soul,&mdash; Have ever shrouded all my earthly ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Hm, Catiline, then is this day your last; Tomorrow morning you
      will be no longer The Catiline you hitherto have been. Distant in barren
      Gaul my life shall run Its course, unknown as is a forest stream.&mdash;
      Now am I wakened from those many visions Of power, of greatness, of a life
      of deeds;&mdash; They vanished like the dew; in my dark soul They
      struggled long and died,&mdash;unseen of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, it is not this dull and drowsy life, Far from all mundane
      tumult, that affrights me. If only for a moment I could shine, And blaze
      in splendor like a shooting star,&mdash; If only by a glorious deed I
      could Immortalize the name of Catiline With everlasting glory and renown,&mdash;
      Then gladly should I, in the hour of triumph, Forsake all things,&mdash;flee
      to a foreign strand;&mdash; I'd plunge the dagger in my exiled heart, Die
      free and happy; for I should have lived!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. But oh,&mdash;to die without first having lived. Can that be
      possible? Shall I so die?
    </p>
    <p>
      [With uplifted hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. A hint, oh angry powers,&mdash;that it is My fate to disappear
      from life forgotten, Without a trace!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Outside behind the pillars.] It is not, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Taken aback.] Who speaks? What warning voice is this I hear? A
      spirit voice from out the underworld!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Comes forward in the moonlight.] I am your shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Terrified.] What,&mdash;the vestal's ghost!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Deep must your soul have sunk if you recoil From me!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Speak! Have you risen from the grave With hatred and with
      vengeance to pursue me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Pursue you,&mdash;did you say? I am your shadow. I must be with you
      wheresoe'er you go.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She comes nearer.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. She lives! O gods,&mdash;then it is she,&mdash;no other, No
      disembodied ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Or ghost or not,&mdash; It matters little; I must follow you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. With mortal hate!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Hate ceases in the grave, As love and all the passions do that
      flourish Within an earthly soul. One thing alone In life and death remains
      unchangeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. And what? Say forth!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Your fate, my Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Only the gods of wisdom know my fate,&mdash; No human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Yet I know your fate. I am your shadow;&mdash;strange, mysterious
      ties Bind us together.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Bonds of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. No! Rose ever spirit from the dankest grave For hate and vengeance?
      Listen, Catiline! The rivers of the underworld have quenched Each earthly
      flame that raged within my breast. As you behold me here, I am no longer
      The stormy Furia,&mdash;wild and passionate,&mdash; Whom once you loved&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You do not hate me then?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ah, now no more. When in the tomb I stood,&mdash; And faltered on
      the path that separates This life from death, at any moment ready To greet
      the underworld,&mdash;lo, seized me then An eerie shuddering; I know not
      what&mdash;; I felt in me a mystic transformation;&mdash; Away flowed
      hate, revenge, my very soul; Each memory vanished and each earthly
      longing;&mdash; Only the name of "Catiline" remains Written in fiery
      letters on my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, wonderful! No matter who you are,&mdash; A human form, a
      shadow from the dead,&mdash; There lies withal a dreadful fascination In
      your dark eyes, in every word you speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Your mind is strong as mine; yet you give up, Disheartened and
      irresolute, each hope Of triumph and dominion. You forsake The
      battlefield, where all your inmost plans Could grow and blossom forth into
      achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I must! Inexorable fate decrees it!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Your fate? Why were you given a hero's strength,&mdash; If not to
      struggle with what you call fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, I have fought enough! Was not my life A constant battle?
      What are my rewards? Disgrace and scorn&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ah, you are fallen low! You struggle towards a high and daring
      goal, Are eager to attain it; yet you fear Each trifling hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Fear is not the reason. The goal I sought is unattainable;&mdash;
      The whole was but a fleeting dream of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now you deceive yourself, my Catiline! You hover still about that
      single project;&mdash; Your soul is noble,&mdash;worthy of a ruler,&mdash;
      And you have friends&mdash;. Ah, wherefore hesitate?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Meditating.] I shall&mdash;? What do you mean&mdash;? With
      civil blood&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Are you a man,&mdash;yet lack a woman's courage? Have you forgot
      that nimble dame of Rome, Who sought the throne straight over a father's
      corpse? I feel myself a Tullia now; but you&mdash;? Scorn and despise
      yourself, O Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Must I despise myself because my soul No longer harbors selfish
      aspirations?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. You stand here at a cross-road in your life; Yonder a dull,
      inactive course awaits you,&mdash; A half-way something, neither sleep nor
      death;&mdash; Before you, on the other hand, you see A sovereign's throne.
      Then choose, my Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You tempt me and allure me to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Cast but the die,&mdash;and in your hand is placed Forevermore the
      welfare of proud Rome. Glory and might your silent fate conceals, And yet
      you falter,&mdash;dare not lift a hand! You journey yonder to the forests,
      where Each longing that you cherished will be quenched. Ah, tell me,
      Catiline, is there no trace Of thirst for glory left within your heart?
      And must this princely soul, for triumphs born, Vanish unknown in yonder
      nameless desert? Hence, then! But know that thus you lose forever What
      here you could by daring deeds attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Go on, go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. With trembling and with fear The future generations will recall
      Your fate. Your life was all a daring game;&mdash; Yet in the lustre of
      atonement it would shine, Known to all men, if with a mighty hand You
      fought your way straight through this surging throng,&mdash; If the dark
      night of thraldom through your rule Gave way before a new-born day of
      freedom,&mdash; If at some time you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Hold! Ah, you have touched The string that quivers deepest in my
      soul. Your every word sounds like a ringing echo Of what my heart has
      whispered day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now, Catiline, I know you once again!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I shall not go! You have recalled to life My youthful zeal, my
      manhood's full-grown longings. Yes, I shall be a light to fallen Rome,&mdash;
      Daze them with fear like some erratic star! You haughty wretches,&mdash;you
      shall soon discover You have not humbled me, though for a time I weakened
      in the heat of battle!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Listen! Whatever be the will of fate,&mdash;whatever The mighty
      gods decree, we must obey. Just so! My hate is gone;&mdash;fate thus
      decreed, And so it had to be! Give me your hand In solemn compact!&mdash;Ah,
      you hesitate? You will not?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Will&mdash;? I gaze upon your eyes: They flash,&mdash;like
      lightning in the gloom of night. Now did you smile! Just so I've often
      pictured Nemesis&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. What? Herself you wish to see,&mdash; Then look within. Have you
      forgot your oath?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, I remember;&mdash;yet you seem to me A Nemesis&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I am an image born From your own soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Meditating.] What is all this you say? I sense but vaguely what
      I fail to grasp; I glimpse mysterious, strangely clouded visions,&mdash;
      But can not understand. I grope in darkness!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. It must be dark here. Darkness is our realm;&mdash; In darkness is
      our rule. Give me your hand In solemn pledge!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Wildly.] O lovely Nemesis,&mdash; My shadow,&mdash;image of my
      very soul,&mdash; Here is my hand in everlasting compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He seizes her hand violently; she looks at him with a stern smile.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now we can never part!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, like a stream Of fire your touch went coursing through my
      veins! 'Tis blood no more that flows, but fiery flames;&mdash; My breast
      now cabins and confines my heart; My sight grows dull. Soon shall a
      flaming sea Illumine with its light the Roman state!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He draws his sword and brandishes it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. My sword! My sword! Do you see how it flashes? Soon will it
      redden in their tepid blood!&mdash; What change is this in me? My brow
      burns hot; A multitude of visions flit before me.&mdash; Vengeance it is,&mdash;triumph
      for all those dreams Of greatness, regal power, and lasting fame. My
      watch-word shall be: livid flames and death! The capitol! Now first I am
      myself!

      no one will overhear us.
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Ah, yes; now let us drink, carouse, enjoy! Who knows how long it
      will be granted us?
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. No, let us first await whatever tidings Lentulus and Cethegus
      have for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Bah, let them bring whatever news they will! Meanwhile the wine
      is here; come, let us taste. Quick, brothers, quick,&mdash;let's have a

      [LENTULUS and CETHEGUS enter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Cease all your song and merriment!
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. What now? Is Catiline not in your company?
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Surely he was quite willing?
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Come, say forth! What was his answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Ah, quite otherwise Than we expected was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Well, all of our proposals he declined;&mdash; He would not even
      hearken to our counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Is this the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. And wherefore would he not?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. In short, he will not. He forsakes his friends,&mdash; Abandons
      us,&mdash;and leaves the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. What? He leaves, you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. 'Tis true;&mdash;he goes away This very night. Yet,&mdash;blamed
      he can not be; His ground was valid&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Fear was his excuse! In danger he forsakes us faithlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. That is the friendship of our Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Never was Catiline faithless or afraid!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. And yet he leaves us now.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Our hopes go with him. Where's now the man to take the
      leadership?
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. He'll not be found; our plan we must forego.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Not yet, not yet, my friends! First you shall hear What I will
      say. Now what have we resolved? That we should win at last by force of
      arms What an unrighteous destiny denied. Tyrants oppress us;&mdash;yet we
      wish to rule. We suffer want;&mdash;yet wealth is our desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANY VOICES. Yes, wealth and power! Wealth and power we want!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Yes, yes; we chose a comrade as our chief, On whom there was no
      doubt we could rely. Our trust he fails and turns his back to danger. Ah,
      brothers,&mdash;be not daunted. He shall learn We can succeed without him.
      What we need Is some one man, fearless and resolute, To take the lead&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. Well, name us such a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. And should I name him, and should he comeforth,&mdash; Will you
      then straightway choose him as your leader?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. Yes, we will choose him!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. Yes, we will, we will!
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Then name him, friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Suppose it were myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. You, Lentulus&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVERAL. [In doubt.] You wish to lead us?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. But can you? Such a task requires The strength and courage of a
      Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. I do not lack the courage, nor the strength. Each to his task!
      Or will you now turn back, Now when the moment seems most opportune? 'Tis
      now or never! All things prophesy Success for us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Good;&mdash;we will follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. We'll follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. Well, now that Catiline Forsakes our cause, you are no doubt the
      man To lead us in our enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Then hear What plan of action I have outlined. First&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE enters hastily.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Here, comrades, here I am!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. He? Oh, damned&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Speak out,&mdash;what do you ask of me? Yet stay; I know already
      what it is. I'll lead you on. Say&mdash;will you follow me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL (EXCEPT LENTULUS). Yes, Catiline,&mdash;we follow if you lead!
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. They have deceived us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. &mdash;and belied your name!
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. They said you did intend to leave the city And wash your hands
      completely of our cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, so I did. Yet now no more; henceforth Only for this great
      purpose do I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. What is this mighty purpose you proclaim?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. My purpose here is higher than you think&mdash; Perhaps than any
      thinks. Ah, hear me, friends! First will I win to us each citizen Who
      prizes liberty and values most The public honor and his country's weal.
      The spirit of ancient Rome is yet alive;&mdash; The last faint spark is
      not yet wholly dead. Now into brilliant flames it shall be fanned, More
      glorious than ever flames before! Alas, too long the stifling gloom of
      thraldom, Dark as the night, lay blanketed on Rome. Behold,&mdash;this
      realm&mdash;though proud and powerful It seems&mdash;totters upon the edge
      of doom. Therefore the stoutest hand must seize the helm. Rome must be
      cleansed,&mdash;cleansed to the very roots; The sluggish we must waken
      from their slumber,&mdash; And crush to earth the power of these wretches
      Who sow their poison in the mind and stifle The slightest promise of a
      better life. Look you,&mdash;'tis civic freedom I would further,&mdash;
      The civic spirit that in former times Was regnant here. Friends, I shall
      conjure back The golden age, when Romans gladly gave Their lives to guard
      the honor of the nation, And all their riches for the public weal!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Ah, Catiline, you rave! Nothing of this Had we in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. What will it profit us To conjure up again those ancient days
      With all their dull simplicity?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. No, no! Might we demand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. &mdash;and means enough to live A gay and carefree life!
    </p>
    <p>
      MANY VOICES. That is our aim!
    </p>
    <p>
      COEPARIUS. Is it for others' happiness and freedom We stake our lives upon
      a throw of dice?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WHOLE GROUP. We want the spoils of victory!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Paltry race! Are you the offspring of those ancient fathers? To
      heap dishonor on your country's name,&mdash; In such a way you would
      preserve its lustre!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. And you dare taunt us,&mdash;you who long since were A
      terrifying token&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. True, I was; I was a terror to the good; and yet, So paltry as
      you are was never I.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Restrain your tongue; we brook no ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANY. No, no,&mdash;we will not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Calmly.] So? You timid brood,&mdash; You dare to think of doing
      something,&mdash;you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Ah, down with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      MANY VOICES. Yes, down with Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They draw their daggers and rush in on him; CATILINE calmly removes the
      cloak from his breast and regards them with a cold, scornful smile; they
      lower their daggers.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Thrust! Thrust! You dare not? Oh, my friends, my friends,&mdash;
      I should respect you, if you plunged your daggers In this uncovered bosom,
      as you threaten. Is there no spark of courage in your souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. He means our weal!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. His taunts we have deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You have, indeed.&mdash;Yet, see,&mdash;the hour is come When
      you can wash away the blot of shame. All that is of the past we will
      forget;&mdash; A new existence is in store for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [With bitterness.] Fool that I am! To stake success on you!
      Burns any zeal within this craven mob?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Carried away.] Time was my dreams were glorious; great visions
      Rushed through my mind or swept before my gaze. I dreamed that, winged
      like Icarus of old, I flew aloft beneath the vault of heaven; I dreamed
      the gods endued my hands with strength Of giants, offered me the lightning
      flash. And this hand seized the lightning in its flight And hurled it at
      the city far beneath. And when the crimson flames lapped all, and rose As
      Rome fell crumbling in a heap of ruins,&mdash; Then called I with a loud
      and mighty voice, And conjured Cato's comrades from the grave; Thousands
      of spirits heard my call and came,&mdash; Took life again&mdash;raised
      Rome from out her ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He breaks off.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. These were but dreams! Gods do not conjure up The by-gone past
      into the light of day,&mdash; And parted spirits never leave the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Wildly.] Is now this hand unable to restore The ancient Rome,
      our Rome it shall destroy. Where marble colonnades now towering stand,
      Pillars of smoke through crackling flames shall whirl; Then shall the
      Capitol crumble from its heights, And palaces and temples sink to ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Swear, comrades, that you dedicate your lives To this great
      purpose! I shall take the lead. Say,&mdash;will you follow me?
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. We'll follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Several seem to be in doubt, and speak in whispers to one another.
      CATILINE regards them with a scornful smile.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [In an undertone.] 'Tis best we follow him. In sunken ruins
      We're likeliest to realize our goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. [Shouting.] Yes, Catiline; we'll all&mdash;all follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Swear to me by the gods of our great sires That you will heed my
      every nod!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WHOLE GROUP. [With uplifted hands.] Yes, yes; We swear in all things
      blindly to obey!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then singly steal your way, by different paths, Into my house.
      Weapons you there will find. I shall come later; you shall then discover
      What plan of action I propose. Now go!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They all go out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Detains CATILINE.] A word! Know you the Allobrogian tribes Have
      to the Senate sent ambassadors With grievances and charges?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, I know. They came today into the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Good. What if we should attune them to our plans? With them all
      Gaul will rise up in revolt; And stir up strife against our enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Reluctant.] Ah, we should seek barbarian allies?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. But such a league is a necessity. With our own strength alone
      the fight is lost; Help from without&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [With a bitter smile.] Ah, Rome is fallen low! Her walls no
      longer harbor men with strength Enough to overthrow a tottering ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They go out.]

      trees. To the left a side-building.]

      [CURIUS, CETHEGUS, and OTHER CONSPIRATORS enter cautiously from the right
      in whispered conversation.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. But is it really true what you relate?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Yes, every word is true. A moment since It was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. He takes charge of all?
    </p>
    <p>
      CETHEGUS. Of everything. Just speak with him yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      [All, except CURIUS, enter the house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. An eerie night! How all my thoughts are tossed About in circles!
      Did I dream perchance? Ah, real or fancied,&mdash;now I am awake,&mdash;
      Whichever way I turn I see her form.
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE enters from the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Goes toward him.] You here, my Curius? I have missed you much.&mdash;
      My visit with the vestal took a turn Quite unexpected&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Confused.] So? Yes, you are right!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I shall no longer think of this affair. It was a visit fraught
      with fate for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Meditating.] The furies, we are told, return at times From the
      dark underworld to follow us Through life forever.&mdash;Ah, if it were
      so!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Uneasy.] What? Have you seen her&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. She was here tonight.&mdash; Yet let this be forgotten. Curius,
      listen,&mdash; A weighty undertaking is on foot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. I know it all. Cethegus told me here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Who knows what issue for this work the gods Have set? Perchance
      it is my destiny To perish now, crushed by malignant forces,&mdash; And
      never reach my goal. Well, be it so! But you, dear Curius, you whom I have
      loved Since childhood,&mdash;you shall not be drawn within This fateful
      maelstrom. Promise me,&mdash;remain Within the city if I elsewhere choose
      To open my attack,&mdash;which is quite likely; Nor aid us till success
      has crowned our work.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Moved.] Oh, what a friend and father! All this care&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You promise this? Then here we say farewell; Wait but a moment;
      I shall soon return.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes into the house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Gazing after him.] He loves me still. Of naught is he
      distrustful.
    </p>
    <p>
      [LENTULUS and OTHER CONSPIRATORS enter from the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Ah, Curius, did not Catiline just now Pass through the garden?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Yes, he is within.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They go into the house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Paces about uneasy.] How shall I curb this longing in my soul?
      There is a restless turmoil in my blood. Ah, Furia,&mdash;what a strange,
      mysterious woman! Where are you? When shall I see your face again?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Where has she fled? Ah, shadow-like she slipped Away, when I had
      freed her from the grave. And those mysterious, prophetic words,&mdash;
      And more, her eyes, gleaming at once and dimmed&mdash;! What if it were
      but madness? Has the grave With all its terror darkened&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Behind him among the trees.] No, pale youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [With a cry.] My Furia! You&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Comes nearer.] Here dwells Catiline. Where he is,&mdash;there must
      Furia also be.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh, come with me, beloved. I shall lead You into safety. Think&mdash;if
      some one saw you!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. The dead need have no fear. Have you forgotten&mdash; You took my
      corpse and brought it from the grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Again those terrifying words! Oh, hear me;&mdash; Come to your
      senses,&mdash;come with me away!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He tries to seize her hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Thrusts him wildly back.] You reckless fool,&mdash;do you not
      shrink with fear Before this child of death, but risen up A fleeting
      moment from the underworld?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Before you now I fear. And yet this fear, This strange, mysterious
      dread, is my delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. What would you me? In vain is all your pleading. I'm of the grave,
      and yonder is my home;&mdash; With dawn's approach I must again be
      speeding Back to the vale of shadows whence I come. You doubt me,&mdash;do
      not think that I have sat Among the pallid shades in Pluto's hall? I tell
      you, I was even now below,&mdash; Beyond the river and the gloomy marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Then lead me there!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. You?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. I shall gladly follow, Though you should lead me through the jaws
      of death!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. It cannot be! On earth we two must part;&mdash; Yonder the dead and
      living dare not meet.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Why do you rob me of my fleeting moments? I've but the hours of
      night in which to work; My task is of the night; I am its herald. But
      where is Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Ah, him you seek?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Yes, him I seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Then him you still pursue?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Why rose I from the spirit underworld Tonight, if not because of
      Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Alas, this fury that has seized your soul&mdash;! Yet you are
      lovely even in your madness. Oh, Furia, think no more of Catiline! Come,
      flee with me! Command me,&mdash;I shall serve you!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He prostrates himself before her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. A prostrate slave I here entreat of you One single look. Oh, hear
      me, Furia, hear me! I love but you! A sweet and lethal fire Consumes my
      soul, and you&mdash;ah, you alone&mdash; Can ease my suffering.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Looks towards the house.] Yonder there's a light&mdash; And many
      men. What now is going on Within the house of Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Jumps up.] Again This name! Around him hover all your thoughts.
      Oh, I could hate him&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Has he then resolved To launch at last the daring enterprise He
      long has cherished?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Then you know&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Yes, all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Ah, then you doubtless know, too, he himself Is foremost in this
      daring enterprise? Yet, I adjure you, beg you, think no more Of Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Answer me this alone; 'Tis all I ask of you. Do you go with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. He is to me a tender father&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Smiling.] He? My Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. He,&mdash;round whom my thoughts Course without rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. My brain is in a tumult&mdash; I hate this man&mdash;! Oh, I could
      murder him!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Did you not lately swear you were prepared To do my bidding?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Ask me what you will; In everything I serve you and obey! I only
      beg,&mdash;forget this Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I shall forget him first&mdash;when he has stepped Into his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Draws back.] Ah, you demand that I&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. You need not use the steel; you can betray His enterprise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Murder and treachery At once! Remember, Furia, he is still My
      foster-father and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. &mdash;My aim in life! Ah, timid fool,&mdash;so you dare speak of
      love,&mdash; Who lack the fortitude to strike him down That stands across
      your path? Away from me!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She turns her back on him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Holding her back.] No;&mdash;do not leave me! I am in all things
      willing! A shudder chills me as I look on you; And yet I cannot break this
      net asunder Wherein you trapped my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Then you are willing?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Why do you mock me with such questioning? If I am willing? Have I
      any will? Your gaze is like the serpent's when 'tis fixed With magic power
      upon the bird, that circles Wildly about in terror-stricken awe, Drawn
      ever nearer to the dreadful fangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Then to your task!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. And when I've sacrificed My friendship to my love for you,&mdash;what
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I shall forget that Catiline existed. Then will my task be ended.
      Ask no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. For this reward I should&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. You hesitate? Is then your hope so faint that you forget What gifts
      a grateful woman can bestow, When first the time&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. By all the powers of night,&mdash; I'll not delay! He only stands
      between us. Then let him perish! Quenched is every spark Of feeling for
      him; every bond is sundered!&mdash; Who are you, lovely vision of the
      night? Near you I'm turned to marble, burned to ashes. My longing chills
      me,&mdash;terror fires the soul; My love is blended hate and sorcery. Who
      am I now? I know myself no more; One thing I know; I am not he I was, Ere
      you I saw. I'll plunge into the deep To follow you! Doomed&mdash;doomed is
      Catiline! I'll to the Capitol. This very night The senate is assembled.
      Then farewell! A written note betrays his enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes out hastily.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [To herself.] The heavens grow dark; soon will the lightning play.
      The end is fast approaching, Catiline;&mdash; With measured steps you
      journey to your grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The Allobrogian ambassadors, AMBIORIX and OLLOVICO, come out of the house
      without noticing FURIA, who stands half concealed in the shade between the
      trees.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. So then it is decided! Venturesome It was to enter into such a
      compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. True; Yet their refusal of each righteous claim Opens no other
      way to liberty. The prize of victory,&mdash;should our friends succeed,&mdash;
      Outweighs indeed the perils of the conflict That now awaits us.
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. Brother, so it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. Emancipation from the rule of Rome,&mdash; Freedom long lost is
      surely worth a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. Now we must hasten homeward with all speed, Kindling through
      Gaul the flames of insurrection. It will be easy to persuade the tribes To
      'rise up in revolt; they'll follow us And join the partisans of Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. Hard will the fight be; mighty still is Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. It must be risked. Come, Ollovico, come!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Calls warningly to them.] Woe unto you!
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. [Startled.] By all the gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. [Terrified.] Ah, hear! A voice cries warning to us in the dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Woe to your people!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. Yonder stands she, brother,&mdash; The pale and ill-foreboding
      shadow. See!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Woe unto all who follow Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      AMBIORIX. Home, home! Away! We'll break all promises!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLLOVICO. A voice has warned us, and we shall obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They go out hurriedly to the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE comes out of the house in the background.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, desperate hope&mdash;to think of crushing Rome With such a
      host of cowards and poltroons! What spurs them on? With frankness they
      confess&mdash; Their only motive is their want and greed. Is it then worth
      the trouble for such aims To shed men's blood? And what have I to win?
      What can I gain?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Invisible among the trees.] Revenge, my Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Startled.] Who speaks! Who wakes the spirit of revenge From
      slumber? Came this voice then from the deep Within my soul? Revenge? Yes,
      that's the word,&mdash; My watch-word and my battle-cry. Revenge! Revenge
      for all the hopes and all the dreams Which ever a vindictive fate
      destroyed! Revenge for all my years of wasted life!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The CONSPIRATORS come armed out of the house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Still rest the shades of darkness on the city. Now is it time to
      break away.
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVERAL. [Whispering.] Away!
    </p>
    <p>
      [AURELIA comes out of the side-building without noticing the
      CONSPIRATORS.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Beloved,&mdash;are you here?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [With a cry.] Aurelia!

    <p>
      AURELIA. Say,&mdash; Have you been waiting for me?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Gracious gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Thrusts her aside.] Woman, away from me!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Speak, Catiline! These many men in arms&mdash;? And you as well&mdash;?
      Oh, you will go&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Wildly.] Yes, by the spirits of night,&mdash; A merry journey!
      See&mdash;this flashing sword! It thirsts for blood! I go&mdash;to quench
      its thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. My hope,&mdash;my dream! Ah, blissful was my dream! Thus am I
      wakened from my dreaming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Silence! Stay here,&mdash;or follow! But my heart is cold To
      tears and lamentations.&mdash;Friends, behold How bright the full moon in
      the west declines! When next that full moon in its orient shines, An
      avalanche of fire shall sweep the state And all its golden glory
      terminate. A thousand years from now, when it shall light Mere crumbling
      ruins in the desert night,&mdash; One pillar in the dust of yonder dome
      Shall tell the weary wanderer: Here stood Rome!

      THIRD ACT

    <p>
      [CATILINE's camp in a wooded field in Etruria. To the right is seen
      CATILINE's tent and close by it an old oak tree. A camp fire is burning
      outside the tent; similar fires are to be seen among the trees in the
      background. It is night. At intervals the moon breaks through the clouds.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [STATILIUS lies stretched out asleep by the camp fire. MANLIUS paces back
      and forth in front of the tent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Such is the way of young and buoyant souls. They slumber on as
      peaceful and secure As though embosomed in their mothers' arms, Instead of
      in a forest wilderness. They rest as though they dream some merry game
      Were held in store for them when they awake, Instead of battle,&mdash;the
      last one, perchance, That will be theirs to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. [Awakes and rises.] Still standing guard? You must be weary?
      I'll relieve you now.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Go rest yourself instead. Youth needs his sleep; His untamed
      passions tax his native strength. 'Tis otherwise when once the hair turns
      gray, When in our veins the blood flows lazily, And age weighs heavily
      upon our shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Yes, you are right. Thus I too shall in time, An old and
      hardened warrior&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Are you sure The fates decreed you such a destiny?
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. And pray, why not? Why all these apprehensions? Has some
      misfortune chanced?
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. You think no doubt That we have naught to fear, foolhardy youth?
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Our troops are strongly reenforced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Indeed,&mdash; With fugitive slaves and gladiators&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. Well,&mdash; Grant that they are; together they may prove No
      little aid, and all the tribes of Gaul Will send us help&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. &mdash;Which has not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. You doubt that the Allobroges will keep Their promised word?
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. I know these people well From days gone by. However, let that
      pass. The day that dawns will doubtless bring to light What destinies the
      gods have set for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. But go the rounds, my friend, and ascertain If all the guards
      perform their proper tasks. For we must fend against a night attack; We
      know not where the enemy makes his stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      [STATILIUS goes into the forest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. [Alone by the camp fire.] The clouds begin to gather thick and
      fast; It is a dark and storm-presaging night;&mdash; A misty fog hangs
      heavy on my breast, As though foreboding mishap to us all. Where is it
      now, that easy carefree spirit With which in former times I went to war?
      Ah, can it be the weight of years alone That now I feel? Strange&mdash;strange,
      indeed,&mdash;last night Even the young seemed sorely out of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. [After a pause.] The gods shall know revenge was not the aim For
      which I joined and followed Catiline. My wrath flared up within me for a
      space When first I felt I had been wronged, insulted;&mdash; The old blood
      is not yet entirely cold; Now and again it courses warmly through my
      veins. But the humiliation is forgotten. I followed Catiline for his own
      sake; And I shall watch o'er him with zealous care. Here stands he all
      alone amidst these hosts Of paltry knaves and dissolute companions. They
      cannot comprehend him,&mdash;he in turn Is far too proud to wish to fathom
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He throws some branches on the fire and remains standing in silence.
      CATILINE comes out of the tent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [To himself.] Midnight approaches. Everything is hushed;&mdash;
      Only to my poor eyes sleep fails to come. Cold is the night wind; 'twill
      refresh my soul And give me strength anew&mdash;. I sorely need it!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He becomes aware of MANLIUS.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. 'Tis you, old Manlius? And do you stand guard Alone on such a
      night?
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Oft have I stood Guard over you in childhood's early days. Say,
      do you not recall?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Those days are gone; With them, my peace; wherever now I go, I'm
      haunted by a multitude of visions. All things find shelter in my bosom,
      Manlius;&mdash; Save peace alone. That&mdash;that is far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Cast off these gloomy thoughts and take your rest! Remember that
      the morrow may require Your utmost strength for our deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I cannot rest. If I but close my eyes One fleeting moment in
      forgetful slumber, I'm tossed about in strange, fantastic dreams. Here on
      my couch I lay now, half asleep, When these same visions reappeared again,
      More strange than ever,&mdash;more mysterious And puzzling&mdash;. Ah, if
      I could only know What this forebodes! But no&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Confide your dream To me. Perhaps I can expound its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [After a pause.] If I slept or if I waked, scarcely can I say;
      Visions fast pursued each other in a mad array. Soon a deepening twilight
      settles over everything; And a night swoops down upon me on her
      wide-spread wing, Terrible and dark, unpierced, save by the lightning's
      flare; I am in a grave-like dungeon, filled with clammy air. Lofty is the
      ceiling and with thunderclouds o'ercast; Multitudes of shadow forms go
      racing wildly past, Whirl around in roaring eddies, as the ocean wave
      Draws the raging storm and breaks against a rocky cave. Yet amid this
      frenzied tumult children often come, Decked in flowers, singing of a
      half-forgotten home. Soon the darkness round them changes to a vivid
      glare,&mdash; Dimly in the center I descry a lonely pair; Ah, two women,&mdash;stern
      the one and gloomy as the night,&mdash; And the other gentle, like the
      evening in its flight. How familiar to my eyes the two lone figures
      seemed! With her smiling countenance the one upon me beamed; Like the
      zigzag lightning flashed the other's piercing eye; Terror seized my soul,&mdash;yet
      on I gazed in ecstasy. Proudly upright stands the one, the other leans in
      weariness On the solitary table, where they play a game of chess. Pawns
      they barter, or they move them now from place to place;&mdash; Then the
      game is lost and won,&mdash;she fades away in space,&mdash; She who
      radiantly smiled, ah, she who lost the game; Instantly the bands of
      children vanish whence they came. Tumult rises; darkness deepens; but from
      out the night Two eyes fix upon me, in a victor's gloating right; Then my
      brain reels; I see nothing but those baleful eyes. But what else I dreamed
      of in that frenzied slumber lies Far within me hidden, buried deep beyond
      recall. Could I but remember. Gone forever is it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Remarkable, indeed, my Catiline, Is this your dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Meditating.] If I could but remember&mdash; But no; my memory
      fails me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Brood no longer Upon these thoughts. For what are dreams, indeed,
      But pale chimeras only, darkling visions, On nothing founded, and by
      naught explained?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, you are right; I will no longer brood;&mdash; Already I am
      calm. But go your way; You need some rest. The meanwhile I shall walk In
      privacy and meditate my plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      [MANLIUS goes into the forest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Paces for some time back and forth by the camp fire, which is
      about to go out; then he stops and speaks thoughtfully.] If I could only&mdash;.
      Ah, it is unmanly To brood and be distressed by thoughts like these. And
      yet,&mdash;here in the stillness of the night, This lonely solitude, again
      I see Rising before me life-like all I dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A SHADOW, attired like an old warrior in armor and toga, stems to rise
      from the earth among the trees a short distance from him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Recoils before THE SHADOW.] Great powers of heaven&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHADOW. Greetings, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What will you have? Who are you, pallid shade?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHADOW. One moment! It is here my right to question,&mdash; And you
      shall answer. Do you no longer know This voice from ages long since passed
      away?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Methinks I do; yet certain I am not&mdash;. But speak, whom seek
      you at this midnight hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHADOW. 'Tis you I seek. Know that this hour alone Is granted me as
      respite here on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. By all the gods! Who are you? Speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHADOW. Be calm! Hither I come to call you to account. Why do you envy
      me the peace of death? Why do you drive me from my earthy dwelling? Why do
      you mar my rest with memories, That I must seek you, whisper menaces, To
      guard the honor I so dearly bought?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Alas! this voice&mdash;! Somehow I seem to know&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHADOW. What is there left of my imperial power? A shadow like myself;
      yes, scarcely that. Both sank into the grave&mdash;and came to naught.
      'Twas dearly bought; dear, dear was it attained. For it I sacrificed all
      peace in life, And waived all claims to peace beyond the grave. And now
      you come and want to wrest from me With daring hands what little I have
      left. Are there not paths enough to noble deeds? Why must you choose the
      one that I have chosen? I gave up everything in life to power; My name&mdash;so
      dreamed I&mdash;should forever stand, Not beaming like a star with
      friendly lustre,&mdash; No, like a flash against the midnight sky! I did
      not covet fame, the goal of hundreds, For magnanimity and noble deeds; Nor
      admiration;&mdash;far too many share That fate already: so will many more
      Until the end of time. Of blood and horror I wished to build me my renown
      and fame. With silent dread, as on some meteor That now appears in mystery
      and is gone Again,&mdash;men should gaze back upon my life, And look
      askance on me, whom no one ever, Before or since then, dared to emulate.
      Yes, thus I dreamed and dreamed,&mdash;and was deceived. Why did I not
      surmise, when you stood near me, The secret thoughts then growing in your
      soul. Yet, Catiline, beware; know that I see Beyond the veil that hides
      from you the future. Written among the stars&mdash;I read your fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You read my fate? Expound it then to me!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
THE SHADOW.  No, first beyond death's gloomy gate
  Shall fade away the mists that hide
  The gruesome and the nobly great,
  Borne ever on by time and tide.
  This from thy book of fate alone
  A liberated soul may tell thee:
  Perish thou shalt by deed thine own,
  And yet a stranger's hand shall fell thee.
</pre>
    <p>
      [THE SHADOW glides away as in a mist.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [After a pause.] Ah, he has vanished. Was it but a dream? No,
      no; even here he stood; the moonbeams played Upon his sallow visage. Yes,
      I knew him! It was the man of blood, the old dictator, Who sallied from
      his grave to frighten me. He feared lest he should lose the victor's
      crown,&mdash; Not the reward of honor, but the terror Whereby his memory
      lives. Are bloodless shades Spurred onward also by the thought of glory?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Paces to and fro uneasily.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. All things storm in upon me. Now Aurelia In gentle admonition
      speaks,&mdash;and now In me reëchoes Furia's warning cry. Nay, more than
      that;&mdash;out of the grave appear The pallid shadows of a by-gone age.
      They threaten me. I should now stop and pause? I should turn back? No. I
      shall venture on Unfaltering;&mdash;the victory soon is mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      [CURIUS comes through the forest in great agitation.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. O Catiline&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Surprised.] What, you,&mdash;you here, my friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. I had to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Wherefore staid you not in town?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Fear prompted me; I had to seek you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You rush for my sake blindly into danger. You thoughtless lad!
      Yet, come into my arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Moves to embrace him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Draws back.] No! Do not touch me! Do not even come near me!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What ails you, my dear Curius?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Up! Break camp! Flee, if you can, even this very hour! On every
      highway come the enemy troops; Your camp is being surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Calm yourself; You rave. Speak, has the journey shaken you&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh no; but save yourself while there is time! You are betrayed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Prostrates himself before him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Starts back.] Betrayed! What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Betrayed by one in friendly guise!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You err; These stormy friends are loyal even as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Then woe to you for all their loyalty!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Compose yourself! It is your love for me, Your interest in my
      safety, that has wakened Imaginary dangers in your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh, do you know these words do murder me? But flee! I do entreat
      you earnestly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Be calm and speak your mind. Why should I flee? The enemy knows
      not where I make my stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Indeed he does,&mdash;he knows your every plan!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What, are you mad? He knows&mdash;? Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh, were it so! But use the hour remaining; Still you may save
      yourself perhaps in flight!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Betrayed? No,&mdash;ten times no; impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Seizes his dagger and holds it out to him.] Catiline, plunge this
      dagger in my bosom;&mdash; Straight through the heart! 'Twas I betrayed
      your plans!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You? What madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Yes, it was in madness! Ask not the reason; scarce I know myself;
      I say,&mdash;I have revealed your every counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [In bitter grief.] Now have you killed my faith in sacred
      friendship!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh, send the dagger home, and torture me No longer with
      forbearance&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Kindly.] Live, my Curius! Arise! You erred;&mdash;but I forgive
      you all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Overcome.] O Catiline, my heart is crushed with grief&mdash;! But
      hasten; flee! There is no time to tarry. Soon will the Roman troops invade
      your camp; They're under way; on every side they come.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Our comrades in the city&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. They are captured;&mdash; Some were imprisoned, most of them were
      killed!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [To himself.] What fate&mdash;what fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Again holds out the dagger to him.] Then plunge it in my heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Looks at him calmly.] No, you were but a tool. You acted well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. Oh, let me die and expiate my sin!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I have forgiven you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [As he goes.] But one thing now Is there to choose!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. [Jumps up.] Yes, flight!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Heroic death!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes away through the forest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CURIUS. 'Tis all in vain! Ruin awaits him here. This mildness is a tenfold
      punishment! I'll follow him; one thing I shall be granted:&mdash; To
      perish fighting by the hero's side!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He rushes out. LENTULUS and TWO GLADIATORS come stealing among the
      trees.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Softly.] Some one was speaking&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE GLADIATORS. Aye, but now all's quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OTHER GLADIATOR. Perchance it was the sentinel relieved Of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. That may be. This is the place; Here shall you wait. Are both
      your weapons sharp, Ground for their purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST GLADIATOR. Bright as is the lightning!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND GLADIATOR. Mine, too, cuts well. In the last Roman games Two
      gladiators died beneath this sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Then stand you ready in this thicket here. And when a man, whom
      I shall designate, Goes toward the tent, then shall you rush out quick And
      strike him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST GLADIATOR. It shall be done!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Both GLADIATORS conceal themselves; LENTULUS goes spying around.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [To himself.] It is a daring game I here attempt;&mdash; Yet
      must it be performed this very night, If done at all.&mdash;If Catiline
      should fall, No one can lead them on except myself; I'll purchase them
      with golden promises, And march without delay upon the city, Where still
      the senate, struck with panic fear, Neglects to arm itself against the
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes in among the trees.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST GLADIATOR. [Softly to the other.] Who is this stranger we must
      fall upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND GLADIATOR. What matters it to us who he may be? Lentulus pays
      our hire; the blame is his: He must himself defend the act we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Returns quickly.] Stand ready now; the man we wait is coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      [LENTULUS and the GLADIATORS lie in wait among the bushes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Soon after, CATILINE comes through the forest and goes toward the tent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Whispering.] Out! Fall upon him! Strike him from behind!
    </p>
    <p>
      [All three rush on CATILINE.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Draws his sword and defends himself.] Ah, scoundrels,&mdash;do
      you dare to&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [To the GLADIATORS.] Cut him down!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Recognizes him.] You, Lentulus, would murder Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST GLADIATOR. [Terrified.] He it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND GLADIATOR. [Draws back.] Catiline! I'll never use The sword on
      him. Come flee!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Both GLADIATORS make their escape.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Then die by mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They fight; CATILINE strikes the sword from the hand of Lentulus; the
      latter tries to escape, but CATILINE holds him fast.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Murderer! Traitor!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Entreating.] Mercy, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I spell your plans upon your countenance. You wished to murder
      me, and put yourself Into the chieftain's place. Was it not so?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Yes, Catiline, it was even so!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Looks at him with repressed scorn.] What then? If 'tis the
      power you want,&mdash;so let it be!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Explain,&mdash;what do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I shall resign; And you may lead the army&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Surprised.] You resign?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I shall. But be prepared for all events; Know this&mdash;our
      undertaking is revealed: The senate is informed of every plan; Its troops
      hem us about&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Now shall I call a council of our friends; Do you come too,&mdash;announce
      your leadership; I shall resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Detains him.] One moment, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Your time is precious; ere the dawn of day You may expect an
      onslaught&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [Anxiously.] Hear me, friend! Surely you jest? It is impossible&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Our project, I have told you, is betrayed. Show now your
      firmness and sagacity!
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Betrayed? Then woe to us!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Smiles scornfully.] You paltry coward! You tremble <i>now</i>;&mdash;yet
      <i>you</i> would murder <i>me</i>; You think a man like you is called to
      rule?
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Forgive me, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Make your escape By hurried flight, if still it can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. Ah, you permit me then&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. And did you think It was my purpose to forsake this post In such
      an hour as this? You little know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. O, Catiline&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Coldly.] Waste not your moments here! Seek your own safety;&mdash;I
      know how to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He turns away from him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LENTULUS. [To himself.] I thank you for these tidings, Catiline;&mdash; I
      shall make use of them to serve my end. 'Twill stand me in good stead now
      that I know This region well; I'll seek the hostile army And guide it
      hitherward by secret paths, To your destruction and to my salvation.&mdash;
      The serpent that you trample in the dust So arrogantly still retains its
      sting!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [After a pause.] This is the trust I built my hopes upon! Thus
      one by one they leave me. Oh ye gods! Treason and cowardice alone stir up
      The sullen currents of their slavish souls. Oh, what a fool am I with all
      my hopes! I would destroy yon viper's nest, that Rome,&mdash; Which is
      long since a heap of sunken ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The sound of arms is heard approaching; he listens.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. They come, they come! Still are there valiant men Among them.
      Ah, the joyous clang of steel! The merry clash of shields against each
      other! Anew the fire kindles in my breast; The reckoning is near,&mdash;the
      mighty hour That settles every doubt. I hail the day!
    </p>
    <p>
      [MANLIUS, STATILIUS, GABINIUS, and many OTHER CONSPIRATORS come through
      the forest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Here, Catiline, come your friends and comrades true; In camp I
      spread the alarm, as you commanded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. And have you told them&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Yes,&mdash;they know our plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      STATILIUS. We know it well, and we shall follow you With sword in hand to
      fight for life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I thank you all, my comrades brave in arms! But do not think, my
      friends, that life or death Is ours to choose;&mdash;our only choice is
      this: Death in heroic battle with the foe, Or death by torture when like
      savage beasts We shall be hounded down relentlessly. Ah, which do you
      prefer? To risk in flight A wretched life prolonged in misery, Or like
      your proud and worthy sires of old To perish nobly on the battlefield?
    </p>
    <p>
      GABINIUS. We choose to fight and die!
    </p>
    <p>
      MANY VOICES. Lead us to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Then let us be off! Through death we shall achieve The glorious
      life of immortality. Our fall, our name, through distant generations Shall
      be proclaimed with lofty pride&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Calls out behind him among the trees.] &mdash;O terror!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME VOICES. Behold,&mdash;a woman&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Startled.] Furia! You&mdash;you here? What brought you here?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ah, I must lead you on To your great goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Where is my goal, then? Speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Each mortal seeks his goal in his own way. And you seek yours
      through ever hopeless strife; The struggle yields defeat and certain
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yet also honor and immortal fame! Go, woman! Great and noble is
      this hour! My heart is closed against your raucous cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      [AURELIA appears in the door of the tent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. My Catiline&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She stops, terrified at the sight of the throng.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Painfully.] Aurelia,&mdash;oh, Aurelia!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. What is the trouble? All this stir in camp&mdash; What is on foot
      here?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You I could forget! What will your fate be now&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Whispers scornfully, unnoticed by AURELIA.] Ah, Catiline, Already
      wavering in your high resolve? Is this your death defiance?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Flaring up.] No, by the gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Comes nearer.] Oh, speak, beloved! Keep me in doubt no longer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [In an undertone behind him.] Flee with your wife&mdash;the while
      your comrades die!
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. Tarry no longer; lead us out to battle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, what a choice! And yet,&mdash;here is no choice;&mdash; I
      must go on,&mdash;I dare not stop midway.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Calls out.] Then follow me to battle on the plain!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Throws herself in his arms.] Catiline,&mdash;do not leave me,&mdash;take
      me with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, stay, Aurelia!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [As before.] Take her, Catiline! Worthy your death will be, as was
      your life, When you are vanquished&mdash;in a woman's arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Thrusts AURELIA aside.] Away, you who would rob me of my fame!
      Death shall o'ertake me in the midst of men. I have a life to atone, a
      name to clear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Just so; just so, my gallant Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. All things I will uproot from out my soul That bind me to my
      life of empty dreams! All that is of the past shall henceforth be As if
      'twere not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Oh, cast me not away! By all the love I bear you, Catiline,&mdash;
      I beg you, I adjure,&mdash;let us not part!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. My heart is dead, my sight is blind to love. From life's great
      mockery I turn my eyes; And gaze but on the dim, yet mighty star Of fame
      that is to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. O gods of mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She leans faint against the tree outside the tent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [To the Warriors.] And now away!
    </p>
    <p>
      MANLIUS. The din of arms I hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVERAL VOICES. They come, they come.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Good! We will heed their warning. Long was our night of shame;
      our dawn is near&mdash;. To battle in the crimson sky of morning! By Roman
      sword, with Roman fortitude, The last of Romans perish in their blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They rush out through the forest; a great alarm, rent with battle-cries,
      is heard from within the camp.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. He is gone forever. My great task in life is done. Cold and rigid
      we shall find him in the morning sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Aside.] In his passion-glutted bosom then should love no longer
      dwell? Was it nothing but a dream? His angry words I heard full well.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Hark, the weapons clash; already at the brink of death he stands;
      Soon a noiseless shadow he will hasten toward the spirit lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Startled.] Who are you, prophetic voice, that yonder comes to
      me, Like the night-owl's cry of warning from some far-off tree! Are you
      from the clammy underworld of spirits come Hence to lead my Catiline into
      your gloomy home?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Home is ay the journey's goal, and all his wanderings lay Through
      the reeking swamps of life&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. But only for a day. Free and noble was his heart, his spirit
      strong and true, Till around it serpent-like a poisoned seedling grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. So the plane-tree, too, keeps fresh and green its leafy dress, Till
      its trunk is smothered in a clinging vine's caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Now did you betray your source. For time and time again Echoed
      from the lips of Catiline this one refrain. You the serpent are, who
      poisoned all my joy in life, Steeled his heart against my kindness through
      your deadly strife. From those waking night-dreams well I know your
      infamy, Like a threat I see you stand between my love and me. With my
      husband at my side I cherished in my breast Longings for a tranquil life,
      a home of peace and rest. Ah, a garden-bed I planted in his weary heart;
      As its fairest ornament our love I hedged apart. Flower and all have you
      uprooted with malignant hand; In the dust it lies where thriving it did
      lately stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Foolish weakling; you would guide the steps of Catiline? Do you not
      perceive his heart was never wholly thine? Think you that in such a soil
      your flower can survive? In the sunny springtime only violets can thrive,
      While the henbane grows in strength beneath a clouded grey; And his soul
      was long ago a clouded autumn day. All is lost to you. Soon dies the spark
      within his breast; As a victim of revenge he shall go to his rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [With increasing vehemence.] Thus he shall not perish; no, by all
      the gods of day! To his weary heart my tears will somehow force a way. If
      I find him pale and gory on the battlefield, I shall throw my arms about
      him and his bosom shield, Breathe upon his speechless lips the love within
      my soul, Ease the pain within him and his suffering mind console. Herald
      of revenge, your victim from you I shall wrest, Bind him to the land of
      sunshine, to a home of rest; If his eyes be dimmed already, stilled his
      beating heart, Linked together arm in arm we shall this life depart. Grant
      me, gods of mercy, in return for what I gave, By the side of him I love,
      the stillness of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Gazes after her.] Seek him, deluded soul;&mdash;I have no fear; I
      hold the victory safe within my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. The roar of battle grows; its rumble blends With death-cries and
      the crash of broken shields. Is he perchance now dying? Still alive? Oh,
      blessed is this hour! The sinking moon Secludes herself in massive
      thunderclouds. One moment more it will be night anew Ere comes the day;&mdash;and
      with the coming day All will be over. In the dark he dies, As in the dark
      he lived. O blessed hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She listens.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now sweeps the wind by, like an autumn gust, And lapses slowly in
      the far-off distance. The ponderous armies slowly sweep the plain. Like
      angry ocean billows on they roll, Unyielding, trampling down the fallen
      dead. Out yonder I hear whines and moans and sighs,&mdash; The final
      lullaby,&mdash;wherewith they lull Themselves to rest and all their pallid
      brothers. Now speaks the night-owl forth to welcome them Into the kingdom
      of the gloomy shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [After a pause.] How still it is. Now is he mine at last,&mdash;
      Aye, mine alone, and mine forevermore. Now we can journey toward the river
      Lethe&mdash; And far beyond where never dawns the day. Yet first I'll seek
      his bleeding body yonder, And freely glut my eyes upon those features,
      Hated and yet so fair, ere they be marred By rising sunshine and by
      watchful vultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She starts to go, but is suddenly startled at something.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. What is that gliding o'er the meadow yonder? Is it the misty vapors
      of the moor That form a picture in the morning chill? Now it draws near.&mdash;The
      shade of Catiline! His spectre&mdash;! I can see his misty eye, His broken
      shield, his sword bereft of blade. Ah, he is surely dead; one thing alone,&mdash;
      Remarkable,&mdash;his wound I do not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE comes through the forest, pale and weary, with drooping head and
      troubled countenance.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [To himself.] "Perish thou shalt by deed thine own, And yet a
      stranger's hand shall fell thee." Such was his prophecy. Now am I fallen&mdash;
      Though struck by no one. Who will solve the riddle?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I greet you after battle, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, who are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I am a shadow's shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You, Furia,&mdash;you it is! You welcome me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Welcome at last into our common home! Now we can go&mdash;two
      shades&mdash;to Charon's bark. Yet first&mdash;accept the wreath of
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She picks some flowers, which she weaves into a wreath during the
      following.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What make you there?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Your brow I shall adorn. But wherefore come you hither all alone? A
      chieftain's ghost ten thousand dead should follow. Then where are all your
      comrades, Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. They slumber, Furia!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Ah, they slumber still?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. They slumber still,&mdash;and they will slumber long. They
      slumber all. Steal softly through the forest, Peer out across the plain,&mdash;disturb
      them not! There will you find them in extended ranks. They fell asleep
      lulled by the clang of steel; They fell asleep,&mdash;and wakened not, as
      I did, When in the distant hills the echoes died. A shadow now you called
      me. True, I am A shadow of myself. But do not think Their slumber yonder
      is so undisturbed And void of dreams. Oh, do not think so!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Speak! What may your comrades dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, you shall hear.&mdash; I led the battle with despairing
      heart, And sought my death beneath the play of swords. To right and left I
      saw my comrades fall; Statilius first,&mdash;then one by one the rest; My
      Curius fell trying to shield my breast; All perished there beneath Rome's
      flaming sword,&mdash; The sword that me alone passed by untouched. Yes,
      Catiline was spared by the sword of Rome. Half-stunned I stood there with
      my broken shield, Aware of nothing as the waves of battle Swept o'er me. I
      recovered first my senses When all grew still again, and I looked up And
      saw the struggle seething&mdash;far behind me! How long I stood there?
      Only this I know,&mdash; I stood alone among my fallen comrades. But there
      was life within those misty eyes; The corners of their mouths betrayed a
      smile; And they addressed their smile and gaze to me, Who stood alone
      erect among the dead,&mdash; Who had for ages fought for them and Rome,&mdash;
      Who stood there lonely and disgraced, untouched By Roman sword. Then
      perished Catiline.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. False have you read your fallen comrades' dreams; False have you
      judged the reason of your fall. Their smiles and glances were but
      invitations To sleep with them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Yes, if I only could!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Have courage,&mdash;spectre of a former hero; Your hour of rest is
      near. Come, bend your head;&mdash; I shall adorn you with the victor's
      crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She offers the wreath to him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Bah,&mdash;what is that? A poppy-wreath&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [With wild glee.] Well, yes; Are not such poppies pretty? They will
      glow Around your forehead like a fringe of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, cast the wreath away! I hate this crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Laughs aloud.] Ah, you prefer the pale and feeble shades? Good! I
      shall bring the garland of green rushes That Sylvia carried in her
      dripping locks, The day she came afloat upon the Tiber?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Alas, what visions&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Shall I bring you rather The thorny brambles from the market-place,
      With crimson-spots, the stain of civic blood, That flowed at your behest,
      my Catiline?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Or would you like a crown of leaves From the old winter oak near
      mother's home, That withered when a young dishonored woman With piercing
      cries distraught leaped in the river?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Pour out at once your measures of revenge Upon my head&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. I am your very eye,&mdash; Your very memory, your very doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. But wherefore now?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. His goal at length attained, The traveller spent looks back from
      whence he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Have I then reached my goal? Is this the goal? I am no longer
      living,&mdash;nor yet buried. Where lies the goal?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. In sight,&mdash;if you but will.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. A will I have no longer; my will perished When all the things I
      willed once, came to naught.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Waves his arms.] Away,&mdash;away from me, ye sallow shades!
      What claim you here of me, ye men and women? I cannot give you&mdash;! Oh,
      this multitude&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. To earth your spirit still is closely bound! These
      thousand-threaded nets asunder tear! Come, let me press this wreath upon
      your locks,&mdash; 'Tis gifted with a strong and soothing virtue; It kills
      the memory, lulls the soul to rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Huskily.] It kills the memory? Dare I trust your word? Then
      press your poison-wreath upon my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Puts the wreath on his head.] Now it is yours! Thus decked you
      shall appear Before the prince of darkness, Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Away! away! I yearn to go below;&mdash; I long to pass into the
      spirit lands. Let us together go! What holds me here? What stays my steps?
      Behind me here I feel Upon the morning sky a misty star;&mdash; It holds
      me in the land of living men; It draws me as the moon attracts the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Away! Away!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. It beckons and it twinkles. I cannot follow you until this light
      Is quenched entirely, or by clouds obscured,&mdash; I see it clearly now;
      'tis not a star; It is a human heart, throbbing and warm; It binds me
      here; it fascinates and draws me As draws the evening star the eye of
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Then stop this beating heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. The dagger in your belt&mdash;. A single thrust,&mdash; The star
      will vanish and the heart will die That stand between us like an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Ah, I should&mdash;? Sharp and shining is the dagger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [With a cry.] Aurelia! O Aurelia, where&mdash;where are you?
      Were you but here&mdash;! No, no,&mdash;I will not see you! And yet
      methinks all would be well again, And peace would come, if I could lay my
      head Upon your bosom and repent&mdash;repent!
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. And what would you repent?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, everything! That I have been, that I have ever lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. 'Tis now too late&mdash;too late! Whence now you stand No path
      leads back again.&mdash;Go try it, fool! Now am I going home. Place you
      your head Upon her breast and see if there you find The blessed peace your
      weary soul desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [With increasing wildness.] Soon will the thousand dead rise up
      again; Dishonored women will their numbers join; And all,&mdash;aye, they
      will all demand of you The life, the blood, the honor you destroyed. In
      terror you will flee into the night,&mdash; Will roam about the earth on
      every strand, Like old Actean, hounded by his dogs,&mdash; A shadow
      hounded by a thousand shades!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. I see it, Furia. Here I have no peace. I am an exile in the
      world of light! I'll go with you into the spirit realms;&mdash; The bond
      that binds me I will tear asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Why grope you with the dagger?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. She shall die.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The lightning strikes and the thunder rolls.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. The mighty powers rejoice at your resolve!&mdash; See, Catiline,&mdash;see,
      yonder comes your wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      [AURELIA comes through the forest in an anxious search.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Where shall I find him? Where&mdash;where can he be! I've
      searched in vain among the dead&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Discovers him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Great heavens,&mdash; My Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She rushes toward him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Bewildered.] Speak not that name again!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. You are alive?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Is about to throw herself in his arms.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Thrusting her aside.] Away! I'm not alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Oh, hear me, dearest&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, I will not hear! I hate you. I see through your cunning
      wiles. You wish to chain me to a living death. Cease staring at me! Ah,
      your eyes torment me,&mdash; They pierce like daggers through my very
      soul! Ah, yes, the dagger! Die! Come, close your eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [He draws the dagger and seizes her by the hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. Keep guard, oh gracious gods, o'er him and me!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Quick, close your eyes; close them, I say;&mdash;in them I see
      the starlight and the morning sky&mdash;. Now shall I quench the heavenly
      star of dawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The thunder rolls again.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Your heart; your blood! Now speak the gods of life Their last
      farewell to you and Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He lifts the dagger toward her bosom; she escapes into the tent; he
      pursues her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Listens.] She stretches out her hand imploringly. She pleads with
      him for life. He hears her not. He strikes her down! She reels in her own
      blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      [CATILINE comes slowly out of the tent with the dagger in his hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Now am I free. Soon I shall cease to be. Now sinks my soul in
      vague oblivion. My eyes are growing dim, my hearing faint, As if through
      rushing waters. Ah, do you know What I have slain with this my little
      dagger? Not her alone,&mdash;but all the hearts on earth,&mdash; All
      living things, all things that grow and bloom;&mdash; The starlight have I
      dimmed, the crescent moon, The flaming sun. Ah, see,&mdash;it fails to
      rise; 'Twill never rise again; the sun is dead. Now is the whole wide
      realm of earth transformed Into a huge and clammy sepulchre, Its vault of
      leaden grey;&mdash;beneath this vault Stand you and I, bereft of light and
      darkness, Of death and life,&mdash;two restless exiled shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. Now stand we, Catiline, before our goal!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. No, one step more&mdash;before I reach my goal. Relieve me of my
      burden! Do you not see, I bend beneath the corpse of Catiline? A dagger
      through the corpse of Catiline!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He shows her the dagger.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Come, Furia, set me free! Come, take this dagger;&mdash; On it
      the star of morning I impaled;&mdash; Take it&mdash;and plunge it
      straightway through the corpse; Then it will loose its hold, and I am
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      FURIA. [Takes the dagger.] Your will be done, whom I have loved in hate!
      Shake off your dust and come with me to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She buries the dagger deep in his heart; he sinks down at the foot of the
      tree.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [After a moment comes to consciousness again, passes his hand
      across his forehead, and speaks faintly.] Now, mysterious voice, your
      prophecy I understand! I shall perish by my own, yet by a stranger's hand.
      Nemesis has wrought her end. Shroud me, gloom of night! Raise your
      billows, murky Styx, roll on in all your might! Ferry me across in safety;
      speed the vessel on Toward the silent prince's realm, the land of shadows
      wan. Two roads there are running yonder; I shall journey dumb Toward the
      left&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [From the tent, pale and faltering, her bosom bloody.] &mdash;no,
      toward the right! Oh, toward Elysium!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Startled.] How this bright and lurid picture fills my soul with
      dread! She herself it is! Aurelia, speak,&mdash;are you not dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Kneels before him.] No, I live that I may still your agonizing
      cry,&mdash; Live that I may lean my bosom on your breast and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, you live!
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. I did but swoon; though my two eyes grew blurred, Dimly yet I
      followed you and heard your every word. And my love a spouse's strength
      again unto me gave;&mdash; Breast to breast, my Catiline, we go into the
      grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. Oh, how gladly would I go! Yet all in vain you sigh. We must
      part. Revenge compels me with a hollow cry. You can hasten, free and
      blithesome, forth to peace and light; I must cross the river Lethe down
      into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The day dawns in the background.]
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [Points toward the increasing light.] No, the terrors and the
      gloom of death love scatters far. See, the storm-clouds vanish; faintly
      gleams the morning star.
    </p>
    <p>
      AURELIA. [With uplifted arms.] Light is victor! Grand and full of
      freshness dawns the day! Follow me, then! Death already speeds me on his
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She sinks down over him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [Presses her to himself and speaks with his last strength.] Oh,
      how sweet! Now I remember my forgotten dream, How the darkness was
      dispersed before a radiant beam, How the song of children ushered in the
      new-born day. Ah, my eye grows dim, my strength is fading fast away; But
      my mind is clearer now than ever it has been: All the wanderings of my
      life loom plainly up within. Yes, my life a tempest was beneath the
      lightning blaze; But my death is like the morning's rosy-tinted haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bends over her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. You have driven the gloom away; peace dwells within my breast. I
      shall seek with you the dwelling place of light and rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATILINE. [He tears the dagger quickly out of his breast and speaks with
      dying voice.] The gods of dawn are smiling in atonement from above; All
      the powers of darkness you have conquered with your love!
    </p>
    <p>
      [During the last scene FURIA has withdrawn farther and farther into the
      background and disappears at last among the trees. CATILINE's head sinks
      down on AURELIA's breast; they die.]

      SCENE I
    </h2>
    <p>
      [At the right of the stage sits RODERIK writing. To the left BLANKA in a
      half reclining position.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
BLANKA.  Lo! the sky in dying glory
  Surges like a sea ablaze,&mdash;
  It is all so still before me,
  Still as in a sylvan maze.
  Summer evening's mellow power
  Settles round us like a dove,
  Hovers like a swan above
  Ocean wave and forest flower.
  In the orange thicket slumber
  Gods and goddesses of yore,
  Stone reminders in great number
  Of a world that is no more.
  Virtue, valor, trust are gone,
  Rich in memory alone;
  Could there be a more complete
  Picture of the South effete?
</pre>
    <p>
      [Rises.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
BLANKA.  But my father has related
  Stories of a distant land,
  Of a life, fresh, unabated,
  Neither carved nor wrought by hand!
  Here the spirit has forever
  Vanished into stone and wave,&mdash;
  There it breathes as free as ever,
  Like a warrior strong and brave!
  When the evening's crystallizing
  Vapors settle on my breast,
  Lo!  I see before me rising
  Norway's snow-illumined crest!
  Here is life decayed and dying,
  Sunk in torpor, still, forlorn,&mdash;
  There go avalanches flying,
  Life anew in death is born!
  If I had the white swan's coat&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [After a pause writing.] "Then, it is said, will Ragnarök have
      stilled The wilder powers, brought forth a chastened life; All-Father,
      Balder, and the gentle Freya Will rule again the race of man in peace!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [After having watched her for a moment.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. But, Blanka, now you dream away again; You stare through space
      completely lost in thought,&mdash; What is it that you seek?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Draws near.] Forgive me, father! I merely followed for a space
      the swan, That sailed on snowy wings across the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. And if I had not stopped you in your flight, My young and pretty
      little swan! who knows How far you might have flown away from me,&mdash;
      Perchance to Thule?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. And indeed why not? To Thule flies the swan in early spring, If
      only to return again each fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Seats herself at his feet.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Yet I&mdash;I am no swan,&mdash;no, call me rather A captured
      falcon, sitting tame and true, A golden ring about his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Well,&mdash;and the ring?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. The ring? That is my love for you, dear father! With that you have
      your youthful falcon bound, I cannot fly,&mdash;not even though I wished
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rises.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. But when I see the swan sail o'er the wave, Light as a cloud
      before the summer wind, Then I remember all that you have told Of the
      heroic life in distant Thule; Then, as it seems, the bird is like a bark
      With dragon head and wings of burnished gold; I see the youthful hero in
      the prow, A copper helmet on his yellow locks, With eyes of blue, a manly,
      heaving breast, His sword held firmly in his mighty hand. I follow him
      upon his rapid course, And all my dreams run riot round his bark, And
      frolic sportively like merry dolphins In fancy's deep and cooling sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. O you,&mdash; You are an ardent dreamer, my good child,&mdash; I
      almost fear your thoughts too often dwell Upon the people in the rugged
      North.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. And, father, whose the fault, if it were so?
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. You mean that I&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Yes, what else could I mean; You live yourself but in the memory
      Of early days among these mighty Norsemen; Do not deny that often as you
      speak Of warlike forays, combats, fights, Your cheek begins to flush, your
      eye to glow; It seems to me that you grow young again.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Yes, yes, but I have reason so to do; For I have lived among them
      in the North, And every bit that memory calls to mind Is like a page to me
      from my own saga. But you, however, fostered in the South, Who never saw
      the silver-tinted mountains, Who never heard the trumpet's echoing song,&mdash;
      Ah, how could you be moved by what I tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Oh, must a human being see and hear All things but with his outer
      senses then? Has not the inner soul, too, eye and ear, With which it can
      both see and hearken well? 'Tis true it is with eyes of flesh I see The
      richly glowing color of the rose; But with the spirit's eye I see within A
      lovely elf, a fairy butterfly, Who archly hides behind the crimson leaves,
      And singeth of a secret power from heaven That gave the flower brightness
      and perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. True, true, my child!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. I almost do believe That just because I do not really see, The
      whole looms up more beautiful in thought; That, father, is the way with
      you at least! The ancient sagas and heroic lays,&mdash; These you
      remember, speak of with delight, And scratch in runic script upon your
      parchment; But if I ask about your youthful life In Norway's distant
      realm, your eyes grow dark, Your lips are silent, and it seems at times
      Your bosom houses gloomy memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [Rises.] Come, speak no more, good child, about the past. Who is
      there then whose youthful memories Are altogether free from self-reproach;
      You know, the Norsemen are a savage lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. But are the warriors of the South less fierce? Have you forgot
      that night, now ten years past, The time the strangers landed on the
      coast, And plundered&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [Visibly ill at ease.] Say no more now,&mdash;let us hence; The
      sundown soon will be upon us;&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [As they go.] Give me your hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. No, wait!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. What is the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. I have today for the first time forgot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. And what have you forgot?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Points to the barrow.] Behold the wreath!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. It is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. The withered one of yesterday; I have forgot today to make the
      change; Yet, let me take you to the cabin first, Then shall I venture out
      in search of flowers; The violet never is so sweet and rare As when the
      dew has bathed its silver lining; The budding rose is never quite so fair
      As when 'tis plucked in child-like sleep reclining!

      a king to avenge and I a father!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Commotion among the VIKINGS.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. A king?
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. A father?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Wait,&mdash;I shall relate How all this stands. You know, my
      father was A mighty viking. Twelve years gone it is Since he the last time
      sallied forth one spring With Asgaut there and all his old time warriors.
      Two years he roamed about from strand to strand, Visiting Bratland,
      Valland, even Blaaland; At length he went and harried Sicily, And there
      heard stories of a wealthy chief, Who lived upon this island in a castle
      With sturdy walls built on a rocky base, And in it there were costly
      treasures hid. At night he took his men and went ashore, And razed the
      castle walls with fire and sword. Himself went foremost like an angry
      bear, And in the fury of the fight saw not How all his warriors fell about
      him dead; And when the morning sun rose in the east, There lay the castle
      smouldering in ruin. Asgaut alone survived with one or two,&mdash; My
      father and the hundred others there Had ridden to Valhalla through the
      flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. I hoisted every sail upon the bark, And turned the prow straight
      homeward to the North; There sought I all in vain for Gandalf king; The
      youthful eagle, I was told, had flown Across the sea to Iceland or the
      Faroes. I hastened after him but found no trace,- Yet everywhere I went
      his name was known; For though his bark sped cloud-like in the storm, Yet
      flew his fame on even swifter wings. At last this spring I found him, as
      you know; It was in Italy; I told him then What things had happened, how
      his father died, And Gandalf swore by all Valhalla's gods Blood-vengeance
      he would take with fire and sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. It is an ancient law and should be honored! But had I been in
      your place, Gandalf king, I should have lingered on in Italy,&mdash; For
      there was gold to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. And honor too.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. That is your loyalty to your dead king.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. Come, come now; no offence; I merely meant The dead could wait
      perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [With suppressed rage.] You paltry race!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. But now that we are here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. Yes; let us raise Unto the king a worthy monument!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHERS. With bloodshed and with fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Now that I like!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. And now away to spy around the island; For even tonight
      blood-vengeance shall be mine; If not, I must myself fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. So he swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I swore it solemnly by all the gods! And once again I swear it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [With a harp on his shoulder has during the preceding emerged
      from among the WARRIORS and cries out imploringly.] Swear not, Gandalf!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What troubles you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Swear not here in this wood! Here in the South our gods can never
      hear; Out on your bark, up North among the hills, There they still hearken
      to you, but not here!
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Have you too breathed the poison of the South?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. In Italy I heard the pious monks Tell lovely stories of the holy
      Christ, And what they told still lingers in my mind Through night and day
      and will no more be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I had you brought with me because in youth You showed great
      promise of poetic gifts. You were to see my bold and warlike deeds, So
      that when I, King Gandalf, old and gray, Sat with my warriors round the
      oaken table, The king's young scald might while away Long winter evenings
      with heroic lays, And sing at last a saga of my deeds; The hero's fame
      voiced in the poet's song Outlives the monument upon his grave. But now,
      be off, and if you choose go cast Your harp aside and don the monkish
      cowl. Aha! King Gandalf has a mighty scald!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The VIKINGS go into the forest to the left; HEMMING follows them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. It is a mouldy time we live in now; Our faith and customs from the
      olden days Are everywhere upon the downward path. Lucky it is that I am
      growing old; My eyes shall never see the North decay. But you, King
      Gandalf, you are young and strong; And wheresoe'er you roam in distant
      lands, Remember that it is a royal task To guard the people and defend the
      gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He follows the rest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [After a pause.] Hm, he has no great confidence in me. 'Tis well
      he went! Whenever he is near, It is as if a burden weighed me down. The
      grim old viking with his rugged face,&mdash; He looks like Asathor, who
      with his belt Of strength and Mjölnir stood within the grove, Carved out
      in marble, near my father's home. My father's home! Who knows, alas! how
      things Around the ancient landmarks now may look!&mdash; Mountains and
      fields are doubtless still the same; The people&mdash;? Have they still
      the same old heart? No, there is fallen mildew o'er the age, And it is
      that which saps the Northern life And eats away like poison what is best.
      Well, I will homeward,&mdash;save what still is left To save before it
      falls to utter ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [After a pause during which he looks around.] How lovely in these
      Southern groves it is; My pine groves can not boast such sweet perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He perceives the mound.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What now? A warrior's grave? No doubt it hides A countryman from
      those more stirring days. A warrior's barrow in the South!&mdash;'Tis only
      just; It was the South gave us our mortal wound. How lovely it is here! It
      brings to mind One winter night when as a lad I sat Upon my father's knee
      before the hearth, The while he told me stories of the gods, Of Odin,
      Balder, and the mighty Thor; And when I mentioned Freya's grove to him, He
      pictured it exactly like this grove,&mdash; But when I asked him something
      more of Freya, What she herself was like, the old man laughed And answered
      as he placed me on my feet, "A woman will in due time tell you that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Listening.] Hush! Footsteps in the forest! Quiet, Gandalf,- They
      bring the first fruits of your blood-revenge!
    </p>
    <p>

      right.]

      SCENE III
    </h2>
    <p>
      [GANDALF. BLANKA with oak leaves in her hair and a basket of flowers
      enters from the left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Seated at the left busily weaving a flower wreath.] Fountains may
      murmur in the sunny vales, Resplendent billows roll beneath the shore; Nor
      fountain's murmur, nor the billow's song Has half the magic of those
      flowers there, That stand in clusters round the barrow's edge And nod at
      one another lovingly; They draw me hither during night and day,&mdash; And
      it is here I long to come and dream. The wreath is done. The hero's
      monument, So hard and cold, shall under it be hid. Yes, it is beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pointing to the mound.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. A vanished life, Of giant strength, lies mouldering in the ground,&mdash;
      And the memorial which should speak to men,&mdash; A cold unyielding stone
      like yonder one! But then comes art, and with a friendly hand She gathers
      flowers from the breast of nature And hides the ugly, unresponsive stone
      With snow-white lilies, sweet forget-me-nots.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She ascends the barrow, hangs the wreath over the monument, and speaks
      after a pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Again my dreams go sailing to the North Like birds of passage o'er
      the ocean waves; I feel an urging where I long to go, And willingly I heed
      the secret power, Which has its royal seat within the soul. I stand in
      Norway, am a hero's bride, And from the mountain peak watch eagle-like.
      O'er shining waves the vessel heaves in sight.&mdash; Oh, like the gull
      fly to your fatherland! I am a Southern child, I cannot wait; I tear the
      oaken wreath out of my hair,&mdash; Take this, my hero! 'Tis the second
      message I greet you with,&mdash;my yearning was the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She throws the wreath. GANDALF steps forth and seizes it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. What's this? There stands a&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [She rubs her eyes and stares amazed at him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it is no dream. Who are you, stranger? What is it you seek Here on the
      shore?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Step first from off the mound,&mdash; Then we can talk at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Comes down.] Well, here I am!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Aside as she looks him over.] The chain mail o'er his breast, the
      copper helmet,&mdash; Exactly as my father has related.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Aloud.] Take off your helmet!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Well, take it off!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Aside.] Two sparkling eyes, locks like a field of grain,&mdash;
      Exactly as I saw him in my dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Who are you, woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. I? A poor, poor child!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yet certainly the fairest on the isle.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. The fairest? That indeed is possible, For here there's no one
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What,&mdash;no one else?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Unless my father be,&mdash;but he is old And has a silver beard,
      as long as this; No, after all I think I win the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. You have a merry spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Not always now!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. But tell me, pray, how this is possible; You say you live alone
      here with your father, Yet I have heard men say most certainly The island
      here is thickly populated?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. It was so once, three years ago or more; But,&mdash;well, it is a
      sad and mournful tale&mdash; Yet you shall hear it if you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yes, certainly!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. You see, three years ago&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Seats herself.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Come, seat yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Steps back a pace.] No, sit you down, I'll stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Three years ago there came, God knows from whence, A warlike band
      of robbers to the isle; They plundered madly as they went about, And
      murdered everything they found alive. A few escaped as best they could by
      flight And sought protection in my father's castle, Which stood upon the
      cliff right near the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Your father's, did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My father's, yes.&mdash; It was a cloudy evening when they burst
      Upon the castle gate, tore through the wall, Rushed in the court, and
      murdered right and left. I fled into the darkness terrified, And sought a
      place of refuge in the forest. I saw our home go whirling up in flames, I
      heard the clang of shields, the cries of death.&mdash; Then everything
      grew still; for all were dead.&mdash; The savage band proceeded to the
      shore And sailed away.&mdash;I sat upon the cliff The morning after, near
      the smouldering ruins. I was the only one whom they had spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. But you just told me that your father lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My foster-father; wait, and you shall hear! I sat upon the cliff
      oppressed and sad, And listened to the awful stillness round; There issued
      forth a faint and feeble cry, As from beneath the rocky cleft beneath my
      feet; I listened full of fear, then went below, And found a stranger, pale
      with loss of blood. I ventured nearer, frightened as I was, Bound up his
      wounds and tended him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. And he?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Told me as he recovered from his wounds, That he had come aboard a
      merchantman, Had reached the island on the very day The castle was
      destroyed,&mdash;took refuge there And fought the robber band with all his
      might Until he fell, faint with the loss of blood, Into the rocky cleft
      wherein I found him. And ever since we two have lived together; He built
      for us a cabin in the wood, I grew to love him more than any one. But you
      must see him,&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. No, wait,&mdash;not now! We meet in ample time, I have no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Well, all right, as you please; but rest assured He would be glad
      to greet you 'neath his roof; For you must know that hospitality Is found
      not only in the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. The North? You know then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Whence you come, you mean? Oh, yes! My father has so often told of
      you That I the moment that I saw you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yet you Were not afraid!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Afraid? And why afraid?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Has he not told you then,&mdash;of course if not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Told me that you were fearless heroes? Yes! But pray, why should
      that frighten me? I know you seek your fame on distant shores, In manly
      combat with all doughty warriors; But I have neither sword nor coat of
      mail, Then why should I fear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. No, of course, of course! But still, those strangers who
      destroyed the castle?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. And what of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Only,&mdash;has not your father Told you from whence they came?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Never! How could he! Strangers they were alike to him and us. But
      if you wish I'll ask him right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Quickly.] No, let it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Ah, now I understand! You wish to know where you can seek them
      now, And take blood-vengeance, as you call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Ah, Blood-vengeance! Thanks! The word I had forgot; You bring me
      back&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. But do you know, it is An ugly practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Going toward the background.] Farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O, you are going?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. We meet in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Tell me this one thing more: What warrior is it rests beneath the
      mound?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. You do not know, and still You scatter flowers on the hero's
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My father led me here one morning early And pointed out to me the
      fresh-made mound, Which I had never seen upon the strand. He bade me say
      my morning prayers out here, And in my supplications to remember Those who
      had harried us with sword and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. And you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Each morning from that day to this I sent a prayer to heaven for
      their salvation; And every evening flowers afresh I wove Into a garland
      for the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yes, strange! How can you pray thus for your enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My faith commands me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Vehemently.] Such a faith is craven; It is the faith which saps
      the hero's strength; 'Twas therefore that the great, heroic life Died
      feebly in the South!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. But now suppose My craven faith, as you see fit to call it, Could
      be transplanted to your virgin soil,&mdash; I know full well, there would
      spring forth a mass Of flowers so luxuriant as to hide The naked mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Let the mountain stand In nakedness until the end of time!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O! Take me with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What do you mean? I sail for home&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Well, I shall sail with you; For I have often traveled in my
      dreams To far-off Norway, where you live mid snow And ice and sombre woods
      of towering pines. There should come mirth and laughter in the hall, If I
      could have my say, I promise you; For I am merry;&mdash;have you any
      scald?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I had one, but the sultry Southern air Has loosened all the
      strings upon his harp,&mdash; They sing no longer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Good! Then shall I be Your scald.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. And you?&mdash;You could go with us there, And leave your father
      and your home?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Laughing.] Aha! You think I meant it seriously?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Was it Only a jest?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Alas! a foolish dream I often used to dream before we met,&mdash;
      Which often I no doubt shall dream again, When you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Suddenly breaking off.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. You stare so fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Do I?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Why, yes! What are you thinking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I? Nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. That is, I scarcely know myself; And yet I do&mdash;and you shall
      hear it now: I thought of you and how you would transplant Your flowers in
      the North, when suddenly My own faith came as if by chance to mind. One
      word therein I never understood Before; now have you taught me what it
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. And that is what?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Valfader, it is said, Receives but half the warriors slain in
      battle; The other half to Freya goes by right. That I could never fully
      comprehend; But&mdash;now I understand,&mdash;I am myself A fallen
      warrior, and to Freya goes The better part of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Amazed.] What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Well, in a word, then know&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Quickly.] No, say it not! I dare not tarry longer here to-night,&mdash;
      My father waits, and I must go; farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. O, you are going?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Takes the wreath of oak leaves which he has let fall and throws
      it around his helmet.] You can keep it now. Lo, what I hitherto bestowed
      on you In dreams, I grant you now awake.

BLANKA.  [Alone.]
  He is gone!  Ah, perfect stillness
  Rules upon the barren strand.
  Perfect stillness, grave-like stillness
  Rules my heart with heavy hand.
  Came he then to vanish only
  Through the mist, a ray of light?
  Soon he flies, a sea-gull lonely,

      [ASGAUT, HEMMING and the VIKINGS, who lead RODERIK between them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [To GANDALF.] A meagre find, yet something, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My father!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She throws herself in his arms.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Blanka! O, my child!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. A woman! He will have company.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Yes, straight to Hell!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O father, wherefore have you never told me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Hush! Hush! my child!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Points to GANDALF.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Is this your chieftain?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [To GANDALF.] This man can tell you how your father died; For he
      was in the thick of it, he says, The only one to get away alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Hush! I will nothing hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Good; let us then Begin the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O God! what will they do?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [In an undertone.] I cannot, Asgaut!
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [Likewise.] Is our king afraid? Has woman's flattering tongue
      beguiled his mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. No matter,&mdash;I have said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Bethink yourself,&mdash; Your standing with your warriors is at
      stake. Your word you pledged Valhalla's mighty gods, And if you fail a
      dastard you'll be judged. Do not forget our faith is insecure&mdash; And
      wavering; one blow can strike its root, And if the blow comes from the
      king above, It will have had a mortal wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Ah me! That was a most unhappy oath I swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [To the VIKINGS.] Now ready, warriors!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Will you murder him, An old, defenseless man?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Down with them both!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. The woman is too fair! Let her Return with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. [Laughing.] Yes, as a warrior maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Stand back!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. O spare,&mdash;O spare at least my child! The slayer of your
      chieftain I will bring you, If you will only spare her!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Quickly.] Bring him here, And she is free. What say you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VIKINGS. She is free!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [To RODERIK.] You promise that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Then fetch him!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Here he stands!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. Ha, that old man!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. O woe!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. No, no, you shall not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Struck by this hand the viking found his death, Now rests he
      peacefully in yonder mound!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. My father's barrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. He was strong and brave; Wherefore I laid him here in viking
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Since he is buried, then,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Though he be buried, The fallen king cries for revenge,&mdash;strike,
      strike!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. He is deceiving you!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [To GANDALF.] Do you not see It is alone his daughter he would
      save? Yet, how should your kind understand a soul That sacrifices all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I do not understand? You do not think I can?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [To the VIKINGS.] He shall not die!
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O father! He is good like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. You mean to break your oath?
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. No, I shall keep it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. Then what have you in mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. Explain!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I swore To take revenge or else to die myself. Well, he is free,&mdash;I
      to Valhalla go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [To RODERIK.] What does he mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Your honor you would save?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Go,&mdash;hold a ship in readiness for me, With hoisted sail, the
      pyre light in the prow; In ancient fashion I shall go aboard! Behold, the
      evening breeze blows from the strand,&mdash; On crimson wings I sail into
      Valhalla!
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOSTEJN goes out to the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Ah, 'tis the woman who has cast her spell on you!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. No, you must live!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. I live? No, to the gods I must be true, I cannot break with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Your oath is bloody, Balder hates it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yes, But Balder lives no longer with us now!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. For you he lives; your soul is gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yes, to my ruin! It became my task As king to keep intact our
      great ideal,&mdash; But I lack strength enough! Come, Asgaut, you Shall
      take the kingly sceptre from my hand; You are a warrior of the truest
      steel; On me the Southern plague has been at work. But if I cannot for my
      people live, I now can die for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Well said, King Gandalf!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Then need no more be said! Die like a hero, Faithful and true unto
      the very end! But now that we must part forever,&mdash;know, That when you
      die yourself to keep your oath You are then likewise marking me for death!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What! You for death?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. My life was like a flower, Transplanted in an unfamiliar soil,
      Which therefore slumbered in its prison folds: Then came a sunbeam from
      the distant home,&mdash; O, that was you, my Gandalf! Opened then The
      flower its calyx. In another hour, Alas! the sunbeam paled,&mdash;the
      flower died!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. O, have I understood you right? You could? Then is my promise
      thrice unfortunate!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. But we shall meet again!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. O, nevermore! You go to heaven and the holy Christ, I to
      Valhalla; silent I shall take My place among the rest,&mdash;but near the
      door; Valhalla's merriment is not for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOSTEJN. [Returns with a banner in his hand.] See, now the bark is ready,
      as you bade.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. O, what a glorious end! Many a man Will envy you, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [To BLANKA.] Farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Farewell! Farewell for life and for eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [Struggling with himself.] Wait! Wait!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Prostrates himself before BLANKA.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Mercy, I cry! Forgive, forgive me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. What means he?
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. All will I confess: My whole life here with you has been deceit!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Ah, terror has unhinged his mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. No, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [To GANDALF, after he has risen.] You are released forever from
      your vow; Your father's shadow needs no blood revenge!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Ah, then explain!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Oh, speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Here stands King Rorek!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME. The fallen king?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. O heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [In doubt.] You,&mdash;my father?
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. See, Asgaut! Do you still recall the scratch You gave me on our
      earliest viking trip, The time we fought about the booty?
    </p>
    <p>
      [He uncovers his arm and shows it to ASGAUT.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Yes, By Thor, it is King Rorek!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [Throws himself in his arms.] Father! Father! A second time now
      have you given me life. My humble thanks!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [Downcast; to BLANKA.] And you now&mdash;what will you Grant the
      old robber?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. Love as hitherto! I am your daughter! Has not three years' care
      Wiped off each spot of blood upon your shield?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Yet now explain,&mdash;how comes it that you live!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. She saved his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. Yes, like a friendly elf She healed my wounds and cared for me,
      And all the while she told me of the faith These quiet people in the South
      believe, Until my rugged heart itself was moved. And day by day I kept the
      truth from her; I did not dare to tell her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. But the mound there?
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. I laid therein my armor and my sword, It seemed to me the grim
      old savage viking Was buried then and there. Each day my child Sent up a
      prayer for him beside the mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Where do you go?
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. Northward again! I now see clearly that my time is past&mdash; So
      likewise is the viking life. I go To Iceland; there the plague has not yet
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGAUT. [To BLANKA.] You, woman, take my place beside the king! For Thor
      is gone&mdash;and Mjölnir out of gear; Through you now Balder rules.&mdash;Farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. Yes, Balder ruleth now, through you, my Blanka! I see the meaning
      of my viking life! 'Twas not alone desire for fame and wealth That drove
      me hence from my forefathers' home; No, that which called me was a secret
      longing, A quiet yearning after Balder. See, Now is the longing stilled,
      now go we home; There will I live in peace among my people.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [To the VIKINGS.] And will you follow?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. We will follow you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. And you, my Blanka?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. I? I too am born A Northern child; for on your mountain sides The
      choicest flowers of my heart took root. To you it was I journeyed in my
      dreams, From you it was that I received my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. And now away!
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. But you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. He comes with us!
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. I shall remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He points to the mound.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. My barrow waits for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. And should I leave you here alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. No, no! Be not afraid! For I shall close his eyes And sing to him
      a saga from the mound; My last song it will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Moved as he seizes GANDALF's hand.] Farewell, my king! Now have
      you found a better scald than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. [With firmness.] It must be so, my Gandalf; you are king, And you
      have sacred duties to discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He puts their hands together.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RODERIK. You are the children of the coming dawn,&mdash; Go yonder where
      the royal throne awaits you; I am the last one of the by-gone age, My
      throne&mdash;it is the barrow&mdash;grant me that!
    </p>
    <p>
      [GANDALF and BLANKA throw themselves silently into his arms. RODERIK
      ascends the burial mound.&mdash;HEMMING with his harp seats himself at his
      feet.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GANDALF. [With resolution.] And now to Norway!
    </p>
    <p>
      HROLLOUG. Home!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. To Norway! Home!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANKA. [Fired as she seizes the banner from JOSTEJN's hand.] Yes, now
      away! Our course shall northward run O'er ocean billow on through storm
      and sun. Soon fades the daylight o'er the glacier's peak, Soon is the
      viking life a memory bleak! Already sits the hero on his mound; The time
      is past when he could sail around With sword and battle cry from strand to
      strand. Thor's hammer will no longer rule the land, The North will be
      itself a giant grave. But bear in mind the pledge All-Fader gave: When
      moss and flowers shall the barrow hide, To Idavold the hero's ghost shall
      ride,&mdash; Then Norway too shall from the grave be brought To chastened
      deeds within the realm of thought!

      SCENE II
    </h2>
    <p>
      [ARNE of Guldvik appears with his relatives, men and women, minstrels,
      etc., in the background to the right on the other side of the river; they
      are all in festive attire. Shortly afterwards HEMMING from the same side.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE RETINUE. See, here goes the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER. No, here!
    </p>
    <p>
      A THIRD. Not at all, it must be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE OF GULDVIK. Well, well, are we now astray again!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE OF GULDVIK. [Calls.] Hemming! Where is Hemming?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Enters.] Here!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Have I not told you to keep yourself close so as to be of some
      service to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. It was Mistress Ingeborg&mdash;she wanted,&mdash;and so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Annoyed.] Mistress Ingeborg! Mistress Ingeborg! Are you Mistress
      Ingeborg's maid? You are my page; it is me you shall serve. Do you not get
      your keep and wage therefor? Come, tell us where the way goes,&mdash;we
      are stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Uncertain.] The way? Well now, I am little acquainted up here,
      but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. I might have known it,&mdash;that is always the service you give me!
      Well, we shall have to spend the night in the wilderness, as sure as I am
      Arne of Guldvik.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Who has in the meantime spied the remnants of the bridge.] Aha,
      no need of that; here we can get across.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Why didn't you tell us so in the first place?
    </p>
    <p>
      [All cross the river and come forward on the stage.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Looks about.] Yes, now I have my bearings again. The river there is
      the boundary between Lady Kirsten's dominions and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Points to the left.] Down there lies her estate; in another hour or
      two we can sit cozily in the bridal house, but then we must hurry along.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Calls.] Ingeborg!&mdash;Hemming! Now where's Ingeborg?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. In the rear, up on the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Points to the right.] She is playing with her bridesmaids; they
      gather green twigs from the cherry trees and run about with joy and
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Bitterly but in subdued voice.] Hemming! this wedding makes me
      sick; there are so many vexations about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Gazes out to the right.] There they run,&mdash;just look at them!
      It was she who hit upon the idea of going over the mountain instead of
      following the highway; we should reach our goal the sooner, she thought;&mdash;and
      yet notwithstanding&mdash;hm! I could go mad over it; tomorrow is she to
      go to the altar. Are these the decorous customs she ought to observe! What
      will Lady Kirsten say when she finds my daughter so ill disciplined?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [As HEMMING starts to speak.] Yes, for that she is; she is ill
      disciplined, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Master! You should never have married your daughter into Lady
      Kirsten's family; Lady Kirsten and her kinsmen are high-born people&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. You art stupid, Hemming! High-born, high-born! Much good that will
      do,&mdash;it neither feeds nor enriches a man. If Lady Kirsten is
      high-born, then I am rich; I have gold in my chests and silver in my
      coffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, but your neighbors make merry over the agreement you have
      concluded with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Ah, let them, let them; it is all because they wish me ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. They say that you have surrendered your legal right in order to
      have Ingeborg married to Olaf Liljekrans; I shouldn't mention it, I
      suppose,&mdash;but a lampoon about you is going the rounds, master!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. You lie in your throat; there is no one dares make a lampoon about
      Arne of Guldvik. I have power; I can oust him from house and home whenever
      I please. Lampoon! And what do you know about lampoons!&mdash;If they have
      composed any songs, it is to the honor of the bride and her father!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Flaring up.] But it is a wretched bit of verse nevertheless, really
      a wretched bit of verse, I tell you. It is no man skilled in the art of
      poetry who has put it together, and if I once get hold of him, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Aha, master! then you know it too? Is there some one who has
      dared sing it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Sing, sing! Now don't stand there and delay me with your twaddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To the others.] Away, my kinsmen; little must we delay if we are to
      reach the bridal house before midnight. You should have heard what Hemming
      is telling. He says there is a rumor around that Lady Kirsten has baked
      and brewed for five whole days in honor of our coming. Is it not so,
      Hemming?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Aye, master!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. He says she owns not the beaker of silver so costly but she places
      it on the table shining and polished; so splendid a feast she has not
      prepared since the king came to visit her blessed lord twenty years ago.
      Is it not true, Hemming?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Aye, master!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Whispering.] But, master, it is ill-thought to say such things;
      Lady Kirsten is proud of her birth; she thinks this marriage is somewhat
      of an honor to you; little you know how she intends to show herself to her
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Softly.] Ah, what nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To the others.] He says Lady Kirsten gives herself no rest; both
      day and night she is busy in pantry and cellar. Is it not&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Startled as he looks out to the right.] Hemming! what is that? See
      here, who is that coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [With a cry.] Lady Kirsten Liljekrans!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. [Astonished.] Lady Kirsten!

      SCENE III

    <p>
      [The Preceding. LADY KIRSTEN comes with her HOUSE CARLS from the left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To her followers, without noticing the others.] Now just a
      little farther and I am sure we shall find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Taken aback, aside.] Arne of Guldvik! Heaven help me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [As he goes to meet her.] The peace of God, Lady Kirsten Liljekrans!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Composes herself and gives him her hand.] The peace of God
      to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Does he then know nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Contentedly.] And well met at the boundary! Indeed, this pleases
      me; yet almost too great is the honor you show me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. What mean you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. I mean too great is the honor you show me, when you travel miles
      over fields and wildernesses in order to bid me welcome on your land.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Ah, Lord Arne&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] He knows nothing as yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And that on a day like this, when you have enough things to attend
      to; 'tis at your house we celebrate the wedding of our children, since my
      estate lies too far from the church, and yet you come here to meet me with
      all your servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Embarrassed.] I beg you, say no more about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Aye, I will speak of it loudly; the village people have said that
      you pride yourself on your noble birth, that you look down upon me and
      mine, and that you entered into the agreement only in order to put an end
      to the long-standing disputes which grew troublesome now that you have
      become a widow and begin to grow old; and if that had not been the case,
      you would never&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. How can you listen to what evil tongues invent? No more will
      we think of our differences which have lasted since the days of your
      ancestors. I think our families have suffered enough these years, yours as
      well as mine. Look around you, Lord Arne! Is not the hillside here like
      the wildest of upland pastures? And yet in our fathers' days it was a
      region much frequented and rich. A bridge there was across the river, and
      a highway from Guldvik to my father's house. But with fire and sword they
      sallied forth from both sides; they laid everything waste that they came
      upon, for it seemed to them that they were too near neighbors. Now all
      sorts of weeds grow in the highway, the bridge is broken, and it is only
      the bear and the wolf that make their homes here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Yes, they ran the road around the mountain below; it is a good deal
      longer and they could thus better keep an eye on one another; but there is
      little need of that now,&mdash;which is well and good for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. To be sure, to be sure! But Ingeborg, the bride, where is
      she? I do not see her, and the bridesmaids likewise are lacking; surely
      she is not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. She follows in the rear; she must shortly be here. But&mdash;listen,
      Lady Kirsten! One thing I will tell you, as well first as last, although,
      I should think, you know it. Ingeborg has at times whims and moods,&mdash;I
      swear to you she has them, however well disciplined she may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Expectant.] Well, what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Is she too&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Such things you must tame; I, as her father, will never succeed, but
      you will no doubt find ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Aye, rest you assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] And Olaf, who is nowhere to be seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Who has looked out to the right.] There comes Mistress Ingeborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] How fair she is advancing foremost in the group!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Slowly to her servants.] You will keep silent about your
      errand up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A SERVANT. You may be sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside, sighing, as he continues to look out to the right.] Ah,
      happy is Olaf, who will have her!

      [The Preceding. INGEBORG and the Bridesmaids come over the bridge.]
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Still in the background.] Why do you run away from me? What
      good will that do? There can be no wedding anyway before I come.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.] Lady Kirsten! you here?
      Well, I am glad of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Casually to the retinue.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [To LADY KIRSTEN as she looks about.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Olaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Woe is me! now it will out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Yes, Olaf, indeed! Ha, ha, ha! I must have been blind; 'tis well the
      bride sees better than I; for I have not noticed that the bridegroom is
      lacking; but now I understand very well how it comes that we meet here,&mdash;it
      is he who is causing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. He&mdash;you mean&mdash;you know, that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. I mean it has grown tedious for him down there in the festive hall.
      Aye, aye, I remember now my own wedding day; at that time I also was
      young. He has had a great desire to meet the bride, and accordingly he
      prevailed upon you to go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. He greatly desired, to be sure, to meet the bride, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Olaf is not here with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Approaches.] Not with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Speak, I beg you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Embarrassed and jestingly.] Truly, it appears the bride
      also is anxious! Come along, come along with me down to the bridal hall;
      there, I imagine he will be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Whispering to ARNE.] Master! remember I gave you warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Suspiciously to LADY KIRSTEN.] First answer me; then shall we
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Well then,&mdash;he is ridden out to the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [As she is about to go.] Come, 'tis fast growing dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. To the hunt?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
LADY KIRSTEN.  Aye!  Does that surprise you?  You know the song
of course:
  "The knight likes to ride in the forest around,
  To test his horse and his hound!"
</pre>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Does he think so little of his young bride that he uses the
      wedding days to go hunting wild animals?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Now you are jesting. Come along, come along!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Who has in the meantime kept his eye on LADY KIRSTEN and her
      retinue.] No, wait, Lady Kirsten! I hardly dare measure myself in wisdom
      with you, but one thing clearly I see, and that is that you are concealing
      your real errand up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Confused.] I? How can you think that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. From one thing and another I can see you are concealing something.
      You are strangely downcast, and yet you pretend to be playful in spirit;
      but it won't do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. 'Tis nothing new for you to think ill of me and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Perhaps; but never did I do so without just cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Bursting out.] As sure as I live, there is something you are hiding
      from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] What will be the end of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. I let myself be fooled by you, but now I see clearly enough. You
      said you came to greet me at the boundary. How did you know we took the
      way over the mountain? It was Ingeborg who suggested this way just as we
      left Guldvik, and no one could have informed you about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [When LADY KIRSTEN does not answer.] You are silent, as I might have
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [In an undertone.] You see, master! Will you now believe what I
      said?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Likewise.] Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Who has in the meantime composed herself.] Well and good,
      Lord Arne! I will be honest with you; let chance take care of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Then tell us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. What mean you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The agreement between us is sealed with word and with hand,&mdash;many
      honorable men whom I see here can bear witness to that: Olaf, my son, was
      to wed your daughter; tomorrow at my house the wedding was to be held&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Impatiently.] Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Dishonor to him who breaks his word, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE AND THE GUESTS.. What then! Speak out!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. There can be no wedding tomorrow as we had agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. No wedding?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. It must be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Ah, shame and disgrace!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. No wedding!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Cursed be you that you play me false!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS. [Threatening, as several of them draw their knives and rush in
      on Lady Kirsten's people.] Revenge! Revenge on the house of Liljekrans!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN'S MEN. [Raise their axes and prepare to defend themselves.]
      Strike too! Down with the men of Guldvik!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Throws herself between the contending parties.] Stop, stop;
      I pray you, stop! Lord Arne! hear me to the end ere you judge my conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Who has tried to quiet his kinsmen, approaches LADY KIRSTEN and
      speaks in a low tone as he tries to overcome his inner agitation, which is
      nevertheless apparent.] Forgive me, Lady Kirsten! I was too quick in my
      wrath. Had I stopped to think I might surely have known the whole was a
      jest on your part; I beg you, do not contradict me, it must be so! No
      wedding tomorrow,&mdash;how could such a thing happen! If it is ale and
      mead you lack, or if you need silver or embroidered linens, then come you
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. It is no poor man's house that your daughter is marrying
      into, Lord Arne! Do you but come to the wedding with all your kinsmen and
      friends, aye, come with three times as many if you wish,&mdash;in my home
      you shall find plenty of room and banquet fare, as much as you may desire.
      Think not for a moment that such an inglorious reason could stand in my
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. You have changed your mind, perchance?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Nor that either! If I have given my word, then am I likewise
      ready to keep it, today just as well as tomorrow; for such was ever the
      custom and rule in my family. But in this instance it is not in my power;
      one there is lacking&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. One! Whom? Surely I should think that when the bride is ready,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. For a wedding two people are needed, the groom as well as
      the bride&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE AND THE GUESTS. Olaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. My betrothed!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, he, my son&mdash;this night he is fled from his home
      and his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUESTS. Fled!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Fled! He!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. As I hope for the grace of heaven, I have no hand therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [With suppressed exasperation.] And the wedding was to be tomorrow!
      My daughter has put on her golden attire; invitations I have sent around
      in the district; my kinsmen and friends come from far away to attend the
      festive day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Flaring up.] Ah, take you good care, if Arne of Guldvik is held up
      to scorn before his neighbors; it shall profit you little,&mdash;that I
      solemnly swear!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You reason unjustly, if you think&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. 'Tis not, Lady Kirsten, for you to say so! We two have an old
      account to settle; it is not the first time that you set your cunning
      traps for me and mine. The race of Guldvik has long had to suffer, when
      you and your kinsmen plotted deception and guile. Power we had,&mdash;we
      had wealth and property too; but you were too crafty for us. You knew how
      to lure us with wily words and ready speech,&mdash;those are wares I am
      little able to reckon as I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Lord Arne! Hear me, I pray!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Continuing.] Now I see clearly that I have behaved like the man who
      built his house on the ice-floe: a thaw came on and down he went to the
      bottom. But you shall have little joy of this. I shall hold you to
      account, Lady Kirsten! You must answer for your son; you it was who made
      love for him, and your affair it will be to keep the word you have given
      me! A fool I was, aye, tenfold a fool, that I put my faith in your glib
      tongue. Those who wished me well gave me warning; my enemies made me an
      object of scorn; but little heed gave I to either. I put on my gala
      attire; kinsmen and friends I gathered together; with song and laughter we
      set out for the festive hall, and then,&mdash;the bridegroom has fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Never will I marry one who holds me so lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Be still!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Softly to ARNE.] Mistress Ingeborg is right; best it is you
      break the agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Be still, I say!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To ARNE.] You may well be rilled with wrath and resentment;
      but if you think I meant to deceive you, you do me the greatest injustice.
      You think we are playing a game of deception with you. But tell me,&mdash;what
      would tempt me and my son to such a thing? Does he not love Ingeborg?
      Where could he choose him a better bride? Is she not fair and lithe? Is
      her father not rich and mighty? Is not her family mentioned with honor as
      far as it is known?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But how then could Olaf&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The lot I have suffered is worse than you think. You will
      pity me instead of growing angry when you have heard.&mdash;Since the sun
      rose this morning I have wandered up here to find him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Up here?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, up here; I must tell you&mdash;you'll be frightened&mdash;but
      nevertheless,&mdash;Olaf is bewitched in the mountain!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUESTS. Bewitched in the mountain!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [At the same time.] Deliver me, God!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. What say you, Lady Kirsten?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. He is bewitched in the mountain! Nothing else can it be.&mdash;Three
      weeks ago, after the betrothal feast at Guldvik, he did not come home till
      far into the next day. Pale he was and moody and quiet as I had never seen
      him before. And thus the days went by; he spoke but little; he lay in his
      bed most of the time and turned his face to the wall; but when evening
      came on, it seemed a strange uneasiness seized him; he saddled his horse
      and rode away, far up the mountain side; but no one dared follow him, and
      no one knew where he went beyond that. Believe me, 'tis evil spirits that
      have charmed his mind; great is the power they wield in here; from the
      time the terrible plague overran the country it has never been quite safe
      in the mountain here; there is scarcely a day goes by but the chalet girls
      hear strange playing and music, although there is no living soul in the
      place whence it comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Bewitched in the mountain! Could such a thing be possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Would to God it were not; but I can no longer doubt it.
      Three days is it now since he last was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And you have seen none who knows where he is?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Alas, no, it is not so easy. Up here a hunter yesterday saw
      him; but he was wild and shy as the deer; he had picked all sorts of
      flowers, and these he scattered before him wherever he went, and all the
      while he whispered strange words. As soon as I heard of this, I set out
      with my people, but we have found nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. You met none who could tell you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You know of course the mountain-side is desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [As he spies THORGJERD, who rises from the river.] Here comes one
      will I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Apprehensively.] Master! Master!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. What now?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Let him go! Do you not see who it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS AND LADY KIRSTEN'S PEOPLE. [Whispering among themselves.]
      Thorgjerd the fiddler! The crazy Thorgjerd!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. He has learned the nixie's songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Let him go, let him go!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. No,&mdash;not even were he the nixie himself&mdash;

      at ARNE's last words he turns about suddenly as if he had been addressed.]

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Let me manage this.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To THORGJERD.] We seek Olaf Liljekrans. Have you met him about here
      today?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Olaf Liljekrans?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Why, yes,&mdash;you know him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Is he not one of the evil men from the villages?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Evil?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. They are all evil there! Olaf Liljekrans curses the little bird
      when it sings on his mother's roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You lie, you fiddler!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. [With an artful smile.] So much the better for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. You ask about Olaf Liljekrans? Has he gone astray in here? You
      seek him and cannot find him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. So much the better for him;&mdash;if it were a lie that I told,
      he will suffer no want.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Speak out what you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Then I should never be done!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. [Mischievously.] Elves and sprites hold sway here. Be you of
      good cheer! If you find him not he is at play with the elves; they are
      fond of all who love little birds, and Olaf, you said.... Go home,&mdash;go
      home again. Olaf is up in the mountain; he suffers no want.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Curse you for saying such things!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To LADY KIRSTEN.] Do not heed what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. [Approaches again.] I go hence now to tune my harp; Olaf
      Liljekrans is up in the mountain,&mdash;there shall his wedding be held.&mdash;Mad
      Thorgjerd must also be there; he can make tables and benches dance, so
      stirring is the music he plays. But you, take you heed; go you home again;
      it is not safe for you here. Have you not heard the old saying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Beware of the elves when they frolic around,
  They may draw you into their play;
  And all that you see and all that you hear
  Will stay with your mind alway.
</pre>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. [Suddenly breaking out with wild joy.] But here there are
      wedding guests,&mdash;ah! Each lady has on her very best gown, each man
      his very best coat,&mdash;now I see. Olaf Liljekrans is likewise a groom
      in the village,&mdash;there also he has a betrothed! Well, you have heard
      of such things before! I know that at any rate once, &mdash;it is years
      ago&mdash;but well I remember....

    <p>
      THORGJERD. [He continues after a moment's pause, more and more wildly.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sir Alvar and Ingrid had plighted their troth,
  She was a sprightly maiden;
  Three blessed long days they feasted and sang,
  With jolly good wine they were laden.
  The bride was fair and the bride was gay,
  The dance of the guests she led,
  When in came the nixie, the evil wight,
  And sat on the edge of the bed.
  Like a fiddler he sat on the edge of the bed,
  And music bewitchingly played.
  Around danced the benches and tables and all,
  As lightly as servant and maid!&mdash;
  The nixie he went through the open door,&mdash;
  The truth it boots not to hide!&mdash;
  And while he played on the harpstrings sweet,
  There followed him ever&mdash;the bride!

      disappeared on the eve of her wedding.

      we'll all help to find him.

    <p>

    <p>
      INGEBORG. Yes, yes, you are right; up there on the slope&mdash;

      HEMMING. Yes, for we had come to pick strawberries.

    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. The bear, ha, ha, ha! We had to cross the swamp just where it
      was the wettest,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. And then I took you in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. And jumped with me from tuft to tuft.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Laughing.] How frightened we were, the two of us!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Of course I was most frightened for your sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. And I for yours&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops suddenly and as she continues to look at him her face assumes an
      imperious and wounded expression.]
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. What is it you stand here and say? Why don't you go? Is it
      fitting to speak thus to your master's daughter? Go, go; you were to find
      my betrothed!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Alas, I forgot your betrothed; I forgot that you are my master's
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. If you find him, I promise you an embroidered jacket for
      Christmas,&mdash;so pleased shall I be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. I don't want any jacket; I serve you neither for gold nor silver,
      neither for keep nor for knightly dress. But now I am off; what lies in my
      power I shall do, if I know it pleases you.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Who has climbed up on a stone and is picking some blossoming
      cherry twigs.] Hemming! how rich is my betrothed?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
HEMMING.  How rich he is I really can't say; but it is said of
his grandsire in the song:
  With golden attire he can provide
  A hundred maids or more for his bride!
So mighty perhaps is not Olaf Liljekrans, but still he owns
both forest and field.
</pre>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Still occupied.] And you, what do you possess?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Sighing.] My poverty&mdash;is all I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. That isn't very much, Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. No, it isn't very much, Mistress Ingeborg!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
INGEBORG.  [Hums, turned away from him, without changing her
position, and still occupied as before.]
  'Tis little my heart is attracted indeed
  To him who has all the wealth he may need!
  Much more I fancy the humble swain,
  The friend of my heart he will ever remain!
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [In the greatest joy.] Ingeborg! O, if what you say is true, I
      must tenfold bless my poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Turns her head and speaks coldly.] I don't understand you; the
      song was only an ancient ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Comes down from the rock with the cherry twigs in her hand, and
      approaches him as she looks at him fixedly.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
INGEBORG.  But I know another song too, and that I will sing for
you:
  The king's court within stand the steeds so fair;
  The suitor who lacks not the courage to dare,&mdash;
  He shoes the yellow, he shoes the gray,
  The swiftest he saddles before it is day!
  He places his bride on the steed behind,
  She follows him safe, she follows him blind.
  He rides with her off, to the sea they hie,
  With him she would willingly live and die!
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [As though beside himself.] Ingeborg! Ingeborg! then nothing
      shall henceforth terrify me! Not that you have a betrothed, not that you
      are my master's daughter;&mdash;yea, as sure as I live, I shall steal you
      tonight!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Vehemently, as she constantly struggles to suppress a smile.]
      Help me, God! what is amiss with you? What is it you are thinking of? Will
      you steal your master's daughter? You must be sick or mad to conceive such
      a thing! Yet, it shall be forgotten&mdash;for this once. Go, now! and
      thank heaven you escape so lightly; for you have certainly earned a blow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Raises the twigs, but lets them fall, and says in a changed
      tone.] &mdash;and my red golden ring&mdash;see there, take it!
    </p>

      quickly to the left.]

      [HEMMING. Shortly afterwards OLAF Liljekrans from the, background. The
      moon rises.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. The golden ring unto me she has granted, Then still is she true,
      I am not deceived! 'Twas only in jest that she scolded and ranted As
      though she were bitterly grieved. All will I venture, no more will I
      dread!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Despondent.] And yet, I am only a penniless swain, And early
      tomorrow is she to be wed!

      should never come home again!

      HEMMING. [Starts to rush out, but stops with a cry.] Olaf! there is he!
    </p>
    <p>
      [OLAF comes slowly forward between the rocks in the background. He walks
      dreaming, his head uncovered, and his hands full of flowers which he tears
      to pieces and scatters on the way; his whole behavior during the following
      indicates an unsettled mind.]

      HEMMING. Lord Olaf! Lord Olaf! O where do you travel? O hear me, Lord
      Olaf!

    <p>
      OLAF. [Half awakening.] Hemming! Is it you? Stand not in my way!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. What is it that weighs On your mind, that you wander in here for
      three days?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Observes him more closely.]
    </p>
    <p>

      white, and your forehead is gray!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Be not so amazed that my cheek is white, Three nights have I fought
      so strange a fight; Be not so amazed that my forehead is gray, Three
      nights have I been in the elfen play.
    </p>
    <p>

      HEMMING. [Apprehensively.] Come, Olaf, with me to your mother's estate!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. My mother's estate! Where stood it of late? 'Tis here, as it seems,
      that I have my home! The wood has become my ancestral hall, The river's
      roaring, the pine-trees' moan, Is sweeter to me than my mother's call.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [With increasing rapture.] Aye, here it is quiet! Aye, here it is
      fair! Behold, my hall for the feast I prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] O what has come o'er him?

    <p>
      OLAF. Soon comes my bride!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Your bride! Then you know&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Continuing.] When the day has died, When slumber the birds, when
      fades the cloud, Then here will she come so young and so proud!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Know you when it was that I saw her here first?
   I rode late one evening from Guldvik hall,
   Some kind of feast I seem to recall.
   My spirit was heavy, my heart full of woe!
   That something had grieved me is all that I know.
   I rode all alone up the mountain side,
   At midnight I passed by the river so wide;
   Then heard I beyond a melodious wail,
   That rang like a song over mountain and dale.
   It seemed a plaintive, bewitching lay;
   I folded my hands, I tried to pray,
   But tied was my tongue and my thoughts went astray;
   The strains did beguile and lure me away.
   'Twas now like weeping and now like laughter,
   'Twas now full of mirth, and now ever after
   As were it the cry of a perishing man,
   As were it a soul in the anguish of death,
   That I heard in the song so beguiling, that ran
   Like a stream around me!&mdash;I scarce got my breath!
   So sorely bewildered was I in my soul;
   It was as if powers both gentle and strong
   Enticed me and lured me away from my goal,
   I needs must come up, I was carried along.
   And ever rang out the mysterious call;
   How far I rode on I no longer recall.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] And the bride, of whom the minstrel sang,&mdash;she too
      had to follow&mdash;

    <h3>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   My foal stopped short, I awoke in a maze,
   I looked around with a wondering gaze;
   'Twas all so pleasant and fair!  But what land
   I was in I could not understand!
   I stood in a valley;&mdash;a deep peace lay
   Over all like dew in the night!
   The moon on the edge of the tarn did play;
   It seemed to laugh as it vanished away
   In the rolling billows so bright!
   My head was heavy, my spirit oppressed,
   I yearned for nothing but sleep;
   I laid me down 'neath a linden to rest
   In the whispering forest so sweet!
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Lord Olaf! Lord Olaf! How dared you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Continuing.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   I ventured then into the elf-maidens' play;
   The fairest of maidens gave me a bouquet
   Of snow-drops blue and of lilies white;
   She pierced my soul with her glances so bright,
   And whispered to me what nobody knows,&mdash;
   A word I'll keep ever in mind:
   "Olaf Liljekrans! know you where happiness grows,
   Know you the hour when peace you will find?
   Of all the flowers on the hill over yonder
   Must you the fairest one find,
   And bit by bit you must tear it asunder
   And scatter it far to the wind,
   Then&mdash;only then will you happiness find!"

   That very same day
   My mother's estate grew cramped and narrow!
   Through thicket, o'er highway, I hastened away
   To the grove so pleasant with bow and with arrow!
   There met I again the elf-maiden fair.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Steps back amazed.] When then,&mdash;have you wakened and found&mdash;?
    </p>

      far into the air; Now is she evermore bound!

      Kirsten shall know!

    <p>

   His wedding tomorrow his people prepare;

   These mysterious words give my spirit no rest.
   The fairest of flowers?  And what is the test?
   Where will it be found?  Is its beauty revealed
   In the fragrance or deep in the blossom concealed?
   Or hid in some magic power that I never
   Can possibly find if I search forever?
   So may there be virtue in many a spear
   Whose steel is rusty and out of gear;
   So too may a harp that no longer sings

    <p>
      [OLAF LILJEKRANS. ALFHILD from the back of the stage. She is fantastically
      dressed and adorned with flowers and garlands of leaves; she looks about
      anxiously until she discovers OLAF and runs joyfully to meet him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. O, stay, stay! Do not go away from me!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [As if suddenly awakened to life.] Alfhild! my young and beautiful
      bride!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Olaf! my handsome knight! I grew tired of waiting; I had to come
      here to meet you!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. But tell me, why are you always afraid to come here?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I have so often told you that I never went beyond this valley
      until you visited me. My father has said that evil powers hold sway out
      there; only here among the mountains could I fare safely and without harm!
      O, let whatever power will hold sway; you are here, and that is enough for
      me! Come, let me look into your eyes! Truly, I have you again!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Have me! Alas, Alfhild! You artful, you beautiful woman, indeed you
      have me again! My soul you have charmed so deeply, so deeply. Lead me
      whither and as far as you will, into the mountain, under the hill, to the
      grassy meadow, where song and refrain echo sweetly in the evening, on the
      bottom of the river, down under the rapids, where there are harps for
      powerful plaintive lays; wherever your home is, there I am ready to
      wander!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Why speak you thus? You must surely know better than what you are
      saying.&mdash;Spirits and elves hold sway in mountain and hillock, and on
      the bottom of the river lives the nixie,&mdash;so father has said. Think
      you that I am an elf or&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You are the fairest in the world; be you what you please, so long as
      you are mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Were I an elfen maid, then truly, say I, it would fare with you
      ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Yes, you! When you rode on your lonely path, I should go out to
      meet you and give you the drink of forgetfulness from the golden horn. I
      should mix therein my magic and charm so that you would forget both heaven
      and earth, forget where you were born and reared, what name you answered
      to, and where your kinsmen fared,&mdash;one thing alone should you
      remember, one thing alone should fill your mind and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Forsooth, then are you the elfen maid! For from the first hour you
      have practiced your magic on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Have I?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Through the meadow I rode, below where the river runs,&mdash;it was
      night and the songs and the plaintive lays echoed strangely around me....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Bewildered I grew and lost my path; I wandered far, far in among the
      mountains; I discovered the beautiful valley, where no foot has trod,
      where no eye has feasted ere mine....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. A heavy slumber fell upon me in there; the elf maidens played in the
      meantime, and they drew me into their play....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. But when I awoke, there was affliction in my soul; homeward I rode,
      but down there I could no more be content; it seemed as if I had left
      behind me the richest and best in life, as if a wonderful treasure were
      held in store for me, if only I sought and found it....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Up to the valley I had to go before I could find peace....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You came to meet me, fair and glowing as in this hour; I seized your
      hand, I looked you in the eye&mdash;heaven and earth, the beauty of all
      creation, was in your eye!....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Then I forgot both kinsmen and friends!....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I came there the next night, I embraced you, I pressed you to my
      bosom,&mdash;the glory of heaven was in your embrace....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. &mdash;Then I forgot my Christian name and my forefathers' home....
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. And I came the third night; I had to come; I kissed your red lips;
      my eyes burned their way into your soul.&mdash;More than the glory of
      creation was therein! I forgot more than God and home, more than heaven
      and earth. I forgot myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Prostrates himself before her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Alfhild! Alfhild!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. If it be a drink of forgetfulness which you speak of, then have I
      also charmed myself with it. I have fared as the minstrel who learned the
      nixie's songs in order to charm his sweetheart;&mdash;he charmed and
      charmed so long that at length the magic wove itself round his own soul
      too, and he could never win himself free therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops and continues standing thoughtfully.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [As he rises.] What are you brooding over?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. High in the mountain there is a rocky ledge so steep that not
      even the eagle can fasten his claws thereon; there stands a lonely birch,&mdash;ill
      does it thrive, it is poor in leaves; but downward it bends its branches
      to the valley which lies far away; it is as though it longed for its
      sisters in the fresh and luxuriant grove, as though it yearned to be
      transplanted in the warm sunny life down below....
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Like the birch in the mountain was also my life; I longed to get
      away; I longed for you through the long, long years, even before I knew
      you existed. The valley became too cramped for me, but I did not know that
      beyond the mountains there was another valley like this one in here. The
      knights and the ladies that visited me every evening were not enough for
      me, and they told me nothing of the life beyond!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Knights and ladies? You told me you never met any one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. No one like you! But every evening my father sang songs to me,
      and when the night came and my eyes were closed, they came to visit me,
      all those that live in my father's songs. Merry knights and beautiful
      ladies there were among them; they came with falcons on their hands,
      riding on stately steeds. They danced in the field, and laughter and
      merriment reechoed wherever they fared; the elves listened silently from
      behind each flower and the birds from the trees where they had fallen
      asleep. But with the coming of dawn they again disappeared; lonely I
      wandered; I decked myself with flowers and with green leaves, for I knew
      the next night they would come again. Alas, that life was after all not
      sufficient for me; a mighty longing rilled my bosom; it would never have
      been stilled if you had not come!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You speak of your father; at no time did I see him in there!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. But seldom he comes now; he has never been there since the night
      we first met.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. But tell me, where is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. You have told me you rode late one summer night in the meadow
      where the river flows; there you heard strange songs which you only half
      understood, but which haunt and haunt you so that you will never forget
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. You once heard my father's songs! It is on them that I have been
      nourished. In truth, neither have I fully understood them; they seemed to
      me to be the most precious treasure, to be life itself; now they mean
      little to me; they are to me but a token of all the glory that was to
      come. In all of them was there a handsome knight; I imagined him to be the
      best and most glorious thing in all the valleys, the best and most
      glorious as far as bird can fly, as far as clouds can sail. Olaf! it was
      you,&mdash;I know you again! Oh, you must tell me of your home, of the
      distant valley whence you come; life out there must be rich and glorious;
      there it must be that my birds all fly with the falling of the leaves; for
      when they again come to visit me, they have so much to tell that is
      strange, so many a marvel to sing about, that all the flowers begin to bud
      and to blossom, the trees to grow green, and the big and glorious sun to
      rise early and go tardily to rest, in order to listen to all the stories
      and songs. But little grasp I of all that they tell; you must interpret it
      for me, you must make everything clear that inwardly craves an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Little am I able to answer what you ask of my home. My home? If I
      have had a home other than this, then I remember but little about it. It
      is all to me like a misty dream which is forgotten in the hour we waken.
      Yet, come! far below us there lies a village; there it seems I remember I
      wandered before I saw you; there it seems to me that my kinsmen live. Do
      you hear how the river conjures and rushes; let us follow it; out on the
      ledge near the waterfall we can overlook the village where I&mdash;once
      had my home. Come, come!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. But dare I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Follow and trust me, I shall protect you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I am ready; I know it well enough; whether I wished to or not, I
      must follow you wherever you go.

    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. And he said he was waiting for the bride who was to come?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, but whom he had in mind I could not quite make out; for his
      speech was strangely incoherent. Ingeborg he did not mean,&mdash;that is
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Say nothing, good Hemming! say nothing of what he just said!
      You did well to let me alone know he was here. You shall be richly
      rewarded for this, but first we must find him again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [As he looks out to the right.] See,&mdash;see there, in the

      LADY KIRSTEN. Do as I say; but say nothing of what you have heard and
      seen. You can say that Olaf came up here to hunt deer and bear, and that
      he went astray in the mountain.

      Yes, so I can pretend to Arne of Guldvik, but little I believe it myself;&mdash;and
      yet it is said it happened often enough in the days gone by. But it is
      elfen maids no doubt of flesh and blood that&mdash;. There he goes down to

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    O, you must tell me still more of the world!
    Your words to my soul are refreshing indeed;
    It seems as if here in the wonders you tell
    My innermost longings you read!....

    Did you ne'er on a summer night sit by a tarn,
    So deep that no one could fathom it quite,
    And see in the water the stars so bright,
    Those knowing eyes that express with their flickering light
    Much more than a thousand tongues could possibly say?

    I often sat thus; I sought with my hands to capture
    The sparkling riddles below in the deep&mdash;
    I snatched after them, I would see them close,
    Then they grew blurred like eyes that weep,&mdash;
    It is idle to search and to seek&mdash;

    So too in my soul there was many a riddle
    I yearned to solve in the days that are gone!
    They tricked me as did all the stars in the deep,
    Grew stranger and stranger the more I brooded thereon!

    Happy I am,&mdash;and that can I understand&mdash;
    Your prophecy failed,&mdash;I should happiness find,
    When the fairest of flowers I had found in the land.
    Ah! happiness here I have found!

   Were built for us two a bower so fair!
   The snowdrops in splendor stand garbed everywhere;
   In here there is feasting, there is joy, there is mirth,
   More real than any I have found on this earth!
   The song rings out from the river so deep;
   It is that which makes me both laugh and weep!
   The song of magic, the mysterious lay,
   Has made me so free, so happy and gay!

    <p>
      [LADY KIRSTEN. Servants and Maids occupied with preparations for the
      wedding.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Let there be no lack of food or drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To herself.] Hard have I labored and struggled to bring
      things to this point; but now I shall give a feast that shall be heralded
      far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To the servants.] Be sure to see that on the banquet table&mdash;yet
      no, I shall attend to that myself. The wine shall be poured into the
      silver flagons; the large drinking horns shall be filled with the Italian
      cider; the ale is for the servants only, and likewise the homebrewed mead;&mdash;and
      listen, be sure to see that there are enough yellow candles in the church;
      the bridal party are not to go to the altar until late in the evening, and
      with red lights shall they be escorted on their way from the banquet hall
      to the church. Go now, all of you, and see that you remember, every one of
      you, the things I have told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The people go.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. God knows this wedding is costing me more than I well can
      bear; but Ingeborg brings with her a good dowry and besides&mdash;Oh,
      well, Arne I shall no doubt be able to manage and rule as I see fit, if he
      is first&mdash;
    </p>

      SCENE II
    </h2>
    <p>
      [LADY KIRSTEN. OLAF comes from the house in festive garb; he is pale and
      thoughtful.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [To himself.] Yesterday and today! There is but a midsummer night
      between the two, and yet it seems to me that both autumn and winter have
      overtaken my soul since the time I wandered up there on the mountain side&mdash;with
      her, with Alfhild!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Notices Lady Kirsten.] Alas, my dear mother, are you there?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Quite so, my son! I like to see you dressed in gold and in
      silk. Now one can see by your dress who it is that is bridegroom tonight.
      I see you have rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I have slept, but little have I rested; for all the while I was
      dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. A bridegroom must dream,&mdash;that is an ancient custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. My fairest dream is ended; let us not think any longer about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Changing the subject.] We shall have a merry time today, I
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. It does not appear that heaven is pleased with my wedding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. There are indications of a storm. Do you see how heavily the clouds
      are gathering in the west?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The brighter the festive candles will shine when you go to
      the church tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Paces back and forth a few times; at length he stops before his
      mother and says.] If I had married a poor man's daughter, without family
      or wealth,&mdash;tell me, mother, what would you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Looks at him sharply.] Why do you ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Answer me first. What would you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Cursed you and gone to my grave in sorrow!&mdash;But tell
      me, why do you ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Ah, it was only a jest; I little thought of doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That I can believe; for you have always held your family in
      high honor. But be merry and gay; tomorrow Ingeborg will sit in there as
      your wife, and then you will find both peace and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Peace and happiness. One thing there is lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. The fairest of flowers which I was to pick asunder and scatter far
      to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The silly dream;&mdash;think no longer about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Perhaps it would be best for me if I could forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. In the ladies' room your betrothed sits with all her maids;
      little have you talked with her today. Do you not want to go in?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [In thought.] Yes, yes! Where is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. In the ladies' room, as I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Lively.] Nothing shall be lacking to her from this day. Shoes with
      silver buckles I shall give her; she shall wear brooches and rings. The
      withered twigs shall be put away; I shall give her a golden necklace to
      wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Of whom do you speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Of Alfhild!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I was speaking of Ingeborg, your betrothed. Olaf! Olaf! You
      make me anxious and worried,&mdash;so strange are you. I could really
      almost believe that she had bewitched you.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. That she has! Yes, forsooth, mother, I have been bewitched. I have
      been in the elf maidens' play; happy and gay I was as long as it lasted,
      but now&mdash;. Through long, long years I shall be weighed down with woe
      as often as I call it to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. If she were a witch, the stake would surely be hers; but she
      is a crafty and wily woman who has lured you on with her fair speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. She is pure as the mother of God herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, yes, but beware! Remember, whatever she is, tomorrow
      you are wed; it would be both sin and shame to you if you longer took
      notice of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I realize it, mother, full well!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. And Ingeborg, whom you have betrothed and who loves you,
      yes, Olaf! loves you with all her heart&mdash;the punishment of heaven
      would be visited on you, in case you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. True, true!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I will not speak of our own circumstances; but you can
      easily see that Arne's daughter can help us greatly in one thing or
      another; our affairs have been going from bad to worse, and if the harvest
      should fail this year I should not in the least be surprised if we had to
      take up the beggar's staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Yes, I know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. With Arne's money we can mend everything; an honorable place
      you will win for yourself among the king's men. Think this carefully over;
      if you have promised Alfhild more than you can fulfil&mdash;and I seem to
      notice in her something like that in spite of her quiet demeanor&mdash;why,
      speak with her about it. Tell her,&mdash;well, tell her anything you
      please; empty-handed she shall not go away from here,&mdash;that you can
      freely promise. See, here she comes! Olaf, my son! think of your betrothed
      and your noble race, think of your old mother who would have to go to her
      grave in shame, in case&mdash;be a man, Olaf! Now I go in to look after
      the banqueting table.

      SCENE IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      [OLAF. ALFHILD from the church.]
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ALFHILD.  [Runs eagerly to meet him.]
   Olaf!  Olaf!  You have led me to the land
   Where I walk amid flowers, where before I trod on sand.
   In truth you have here so pleasant an isle,
   O here I can live without worry or guile!
   So much I would question, so little I know,
   The riddles must you explain as we go.&mdash;
   Is it green here always in summer and spring?

   OLAF.  Alfhild!

   ALFHILD.  Your answer delay!
   You see yon house with its spire and wing?
   There went I this morning to play;
   Without there was joy, there was laughter and mirth;
   Within it was still as nowhere on earth.
   I stepped through the door, I saw a great hall,
   Within was a peace that was fair;
   A dawn softly breaking pervaded it all,
   And people were kneeling in prayer.
   But high from above them a virgin looked down,
   She sailed upon clouds of white,
   Her head shone forth like a crimson crown,
   Like heaven when dawns the light.
   Calm was her face, a blue dress she wore,
   A beautiful elf in her arms she bore,
   And round about her played angels of love,
   That laughed when they saw me below in the door
   From their place in the heavens above!

   OLAF.  [Aside.]  Alas!  I have wrought so woeful a play,
   Soon will her sorrow begin!

   ALFHILD.  O, tell me, Olaf! what people are they
   Who live in the house I was in?

   OLAF.  Each one who like you is good and kind,
   Each one who is child-like in spirit and mind.
   'Tis the church, God's house,&mdash;it belongs to him.

   ALFHILD.  The mighty father!  'Tis only your whim!
   His house is high over the stars in the sky,
   Where the white swan sails undefiled,
   So high 'tis beyond any mortal eye
   Save that of the dreaming child!&mdash;
   The church that you spoke of!  So then it is there
   We shall ride in festal procession,
   As bridegroom and bride!

   OLAF.  [Aside.]  No longer I dare
   Delay my wretched confession!

   ALFHILD.  Ah, each of your words has burned like a coal,
   And deep its mark it has left on my soul!
   My bosom is filled with joy and with song;
   Wherever I wander in field or at home,
   They shine on my path, they light me along,&mdash;
   Like stars at night in the heavenly dome!
   You said the whole world would be asked to the feast,
   And foremost should ride the minstrel and priest,
   Knights should go forward and guide my steed,
   And roses should blossom on every side,
   Each lily we met should bow like a weed,
   The flowers should curtsy before the bride!

   OLAF.  Have I said&mdash;

    ALFHILD.  Olaf, you surely recall!
   All things have followed your every desire;
   The lindens stand yonder so green and so tall;
   The roses are decked in their festive attire
   And dance like elves at an elfen ball.
   Never did heaven's illumining eye
   So radiantly shine as here from the sky;
   Never before sang the birds so sweet!
   They sing the bride and the bridegroom to greet!&mdash;
   O, you&mdash;you make me so happy and blessed,
   Both heaven and earth could I hold to my breast!
   Nowhere can so humble a weed be found
   Which under my feet I could crush and destroy,
   Nowhere a creature so deep in the ground,
   But I would share in its sorrow and joy!
   My bosom is filled with the glory of spring;
   It surges and roars like a wood in a storm!

   OLAF.  [Aside.]  And soon this youthful and lovely form
   Shall writhe beneath sorrow's tormenting sting!

   ALFHILD.  O, glorious life!

   [She kneels with upstretched arms.]

   ALFHILD.  O father of love,
   In the distant heaven!  Had I but the power,
   The tongues of the angels above,
   Thy praise I should sing every hour;
   I cannot, for I am of little worth,
   I can only bow down before you to the earth&mdash;
   O thanks, thou unspeakable!  Glory and praise
   For all I can here understand of thy ways!

   [She rises.]

   ALFHILD.  Yes, lovely is life in its every breath,
   As lovely almost as the journey to death!

   OLAF.  In the grave you think it is pleasant to lie?

   ALFHILD.  I know not your meaning, but I brooded long.
   And asked of my father "What means it to die?"
   In answer thereto he sang me a song:

     "When the child of man is weighted with grief
     And longs to be rocked to rest,
     Then comes there an elf with wings of white
     And frees its spirit oppressed.

     "The little elf with his wings of white
     Makes ready a downy bed,
     Of lilies he weaves the linen sheets
     And pillows of roses red.

     "Away on the pillows he carries the child,
     He carries it safe on his arm,
     He takes it to heaven aloft on a cloud
     Away from all earthly harm.

     "And cherubs there are in the heaven above
     (I tell what is true to you);
     They strew the pillows of rosy red
     With pearls of white and of blue.

     "Then wakens the little earthly child,
     It wakens to heavenly mirth,&mdash;
     But all that happiness, all that joy
     There's no one that knows here on earth."

   OLAF.  'Twere better, alas! had you never come here,
   Had you lived in the mountain your peaceful life.
   Your joy like a weed will wither and sear,
   Your faith will be killed&mdash;

   ALFHILD.  But as Olaf's wife
   I am strong as the torrent and have no fear!
   With you by my side let happen what may,
   With you I will laugh and suffer and languish.

   ALFHILD.  [Listening.]  Hush, Olaf!  You hear that mournful lay,
   It sounds like a song of the bitterest anguish!

   CHORUS OF PALLBEARERS.  [Softly outside to the right.]
     The little child we carry
     With sorrow to the grave,
     Beneath the mould we bury
     What soon the worms will crave.

     Hard is this lot and dreary:
     With mournful dirge and sigh
     To carry sad and weary
     The child where it shall lie!

   ALFHILD.  [Uncertain and anxious.]
   What is it, Olaf?  What is it, I say?

   OLAF.  A child that death is bearing away,
   A mother and children weep on the way.

   ALFHILD.  Death!  Then where are the pillows of red,
   The lily-white linen, and where is the dead?

   OLAF.  I see no pillows of red or of gray,
   But only the dark black boards of the bier;
   And thereon the dead sleeps on shavings and hay.

   ALFHILD.  On shavings and hay?

   OLAF.  That is all there is here!

   ALFHILD.  And where is the elf who bears on his arm
   The child far away from all earthly harm?

   OLAF.  I see but a mother whose heart will break,
   And little children who follow the wake.

   ALFHILD.  And where are the pearls of blue and of white,
   That the angels strew in the heaven of light?

   OLAF.  I see only this,&mdash;they weep many a tear
   As they stand at the side of the bier.

   ALFHILD.  And where is the home, the house of God,
   Where the dead dream only of mirth?

   OLAF.  Behold!  Now they place him beneath the sod
   And cover him over with earth.

   ALFHILD.  [Quiet and thoughtful, after a pause.]
   Not so was death in the song&mdash;not so.

   OLAF.  'Tis true; but no such joy and pleasure
   Has any one felt here below.&mdash;
   Have you never heard of the mountain king's treasure,
   Which night after night like gold would glow;
   But if you would seize the gold in your hand,
   You nothing would find save gravel and sand;
   And listen, Alfhild! it often is true
   That life turns out in the selfsame way;
   Approach not too near, it may happen to you,
   That you burn your fingers some day.
   'Tis true it may shine like a heavenly star,
   But only when seen from afar.

   [He becomes aware of Lady Kirsten off the stage to the right.]

   OLAF.  My mother&mdash;she'll tell you&mdash;I shall depart.
   The angels above send their peace to your heart!
</pre>
    <p>
      [He goes towards the house but is stopped by LADY KIRSTEN.&mdash;The sky
      becomes overcast with dark clouds; the wind begins to howl in the
      tree-tops.&mdash;ALFHILD stands absorbed in deep thought.]

      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] There we have it; she thinks to hold him in her
      wiles even after he is wed. Well, we shall see about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Alfhild! I wish you every possible good, and if you
      dared rely on my&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Yes, that I certainly dare!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Well and good; then you will let me take upon myself your
      happiness. I shall take charge of you as best I know how, and if you but
      give me your word you shall this very night go to the church as a bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Yes, I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Surprised.] You know that! Who has told you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Olaf himself said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Has Olaf&mdash;? Yes, forsooth, he has had the same
      idea that I had, to marry her off in order to be rid of her. Or perhaps in
      order to&mdash;well, no matter,&mdash;when she is finally married, when
      Olaf on his side is a married man, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Well and good, Alfhild! If Olaf has told you our
      intention for you, then it is not necessary for me to&mdash;But do you now
      hasten, go in there in the store house; there you will find my own wedding
      gown; that you shall wear!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [With childlike joy.] Shall I! Your own wedding gown!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Do as I say. Go in there and dress yourself as splendidly as
      you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. And do I also get a bridal crown?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Certainly! A bridal crown and silver rings and golden
      bracelet. You will find plenty of them in the coffers and chests.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Silver rings and golden bracelets!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Go, go, and hurry as fast as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. O, I shall not be long about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Claps her hands.]

    <p>
      ALFHILD. I shall have silver rings and golden bracelets!

    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The evil and cursed woman! Happy and gay she is though she
      knows that Olaf is to wed another. But that very fact will serve me well;
      it will go easier than I had thought. She looks as innocent as a child,
      and yet she can agree to take him as a husband whom I first pick out for
      her. And I who thought that she truly loved Olaf! If he is still ignorant
      of her real spirit, he shall soon learn. He shall know her to the core, he
      shall know how she has bewitched and lured him, and then, well, then she
      is no longer dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Smiling.] Well, well! Olaf thought of the same way of
      saving himself that I did; so good-natured I had never imagined him.&mdash;But
      where shall we find the man who is willing to&mdash;well, she is pretty,
      and I shall not mind a little silver and even a bit of land. Has Olaf
      already spoken to some one? That is hardly thinkable!&mdash;Well, then I
      shall see to that. I have servants enough on the estate and&mdash;

    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Hemming! what if I should try him! But he saw them together
      in the mountain yesterday; he must surely know there is something between
      the two. But none the less&mdash;he is a humble serving-man, and poor
      besides, and weak of mind&mdash;we shall see, we shall see!

      SCENE VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      [LADY KIRSTEN. HEMMING from the right.]
    </h3>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [To himself.] Nowhere is Ingeborg to be found; she will bring me
      to my grave,&mdash;that is certain. Yesterday she was gracious to me; she
      gave me her ring; but then she took it away from me again; and today she
      will not so much as look at me as I pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Slowly, as she approaches.] A little cautious I must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Ah, Hemming, is it you? You prefer to wander alone,
      I see; you keep yourself away from the servants and maids; when I see such
      things I realize very well that you do so not without reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Why, my noble lady! what should&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, Hemming! there is something that you keep all to
      yourself as you go about; you are not very cheerful!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Disconcerted.] Not cheerful? I?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Smiling.] There is here today a young and beautiful girl
      whom you fancy very much.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 HEMMING.  All saints!
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. And she in turn has a fancy for you.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 HEMMING.  Me&mdash;Whom?  I do not know whom you mean.
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Come, Hemming, do not speak so; before me you need not feel
      ashamed. Yes, yes, I see clearly, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] Heaven! she must have noticed by Ingeborg's manner that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I have seen that the wedding is but little joy to you. The
      trip to the church you care little about, since you would yourself like to
      go as a groom, yet cannot see your way clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [In the greatest agitation.] Alas, Lady Kirsten! my noble, august
      lady! be not offended!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Surprised.] I? And why should I be offended?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Continuing.] I have struggled and fought against this unhappy
      love as long as I have been able, and I honestly believe she has done the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. She? Has she then told you that she cares for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, almost!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Well and good; then you talked about it together?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes,&mdash;but only once, only one single time, I swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Once or ten times, it is all the same to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Then they are already agreed; it was certainly a
      stroke of luck that I came upon Hemming; now I am not at all surprised
      that Alfhild was so willing to go to the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Hemming! I am much indebted to you for finding my
      son again and for otherwise being of help to me; now I shall make
      requital,&mdash;I shall to the limit of my power stand by you in the
      matter we just spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Overcome with joy.] You! You will! Lady Kirsten! Alas, great God
      and holy saints! I hardly dare believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Stops.] But Lord Olaf, your son! What do you think he will
      say?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. He will not interpose any objection,&mdash;I shall see to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Unsuspecting.] Yes, truly, it would be best for him too, for I
      know she cares little for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Smiling.] That I have noticed, Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Have you! Well, you are so clever, Lady Kirsten! And I who
      thought that I was the only one who had noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Doubtfully.] Do you think that Lord Arne will give his consent?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Your master? I shall know how to talk him into it,&mdash;that
      will not be so difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. You think so? Alas, but I am so poor a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I shall remedy that all right, in case Lord Arne is not
      prepared to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Thanks, thanks, Lady Kirsten! Heaven reward you for your
      kindness!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. But you will keep this that we have been speaking of to
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. That I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Then hold yourself in readiness; the guests will assemble
      out here in a little while now, and do you be on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She goes over to the door of the store house and looks for ALFHILD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [To himself.] No, this is to me like a strange illusive dream.
      Ingeborg and I,&mdash;we are to belong to each other! Ah, can it be true?
      So high I never dared let my thoughts ascend;&mdash;it seemed to me in the
      morning that I had been guilty of the greatest presumption if during the
      night I had dreamed about it.&mdash;Hm! I know very well of course that it
      is not for my sake that Lady Kirsten goes to all this trouble. She has
      something up her sleeve; she thinks it necessary to break the agreement
      with Lord Arne, and now that she has noticed that Ingeborg cares for me
      she will use that as an excuse. Well, I have so often given my master
      warning, but he will never believe me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Calls outside to the left.] Hemming! Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Comes forward.] Your master calls! Go now! After a while I
      shall speak to him; he will agree. Believe me, he shall follow his page to
      the church in the same hour that he leads his daughter thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Thanks, thanks, Lady Kirsten! Truly, you confer a blessing on us
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes out to the left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To herself.] So young she is and yet so cunning; she has
      been coquetting with Hemming all the while she made my son believe that&mdash;Well
      and good, he shall soon learn to know her arts. But first I must see Lord
      Arne; he thinks highly of Hemming and would reluctantly part with him; it
      seemed too that Hemming feared that something like that might stand in the
      way; but they can easily remain as they are even if Hemming marries.&mdash;Hemming
      sees more clearly in the affair than I had expected. What will Olaf say,
      he asked; he has evidently noticed that my son still thinks of Alfhild.
      Well, let him; if he takes her he will say nothing, and when Alfhild is
      married,&mdash;I know Olaf; he has always wanted to stand in high honor
      among the men of the village, and for that reason he will certainly&mdash;yes,
      yes, it must, it shall succeed.

      [HEMMING comes from the left with a bowl of ale hidden under his coat.
      ARNE follows him cautiously, looking about.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Is there anyone?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. No, come along, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But it seemed to me I heard Lady Kirsten.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. She is gone now, come along!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Sits down on the bench to the left.] Hemming! it is well that the
      wedding is to be held tonight. Tomorrow I go home; yes, that I will. Not a
      day longer will I remain in Lady Kirsten's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Why, master! is there enmity again between you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Is it not enough, do you think, that she and all her superior
      relatives look down on me; at supper they laughed and jested among
      themselves because I could not bring myself to eat of all those ungodly,
      outlandish dishes. And what was it that we got to drink? Sweet wine and
      cider that will stay in my stomach for eight days. No, the good old
      homebrewed ale for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Drinks and adds softly and bitterly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Of this I had sent the wretched woman three full barrels. And what
      has she done? Thrown it to her servants, and here I must steal myself a
      drink,&mdash;yes, Hemming! steal myself a drink of my own ale, that they
      may not revile me as a coarse peasant, who doesn't understand the more
      refined drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Well, master! I gave you warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Ah&mdash;gave me warning! You are stupid, Hemming! You think I
      haven't noticed it myself; but wait, just wait!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Flaring up.] To place my good nourishing ale before the house
      servants, as though it were not worthy to be put on the table of a lord.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, Lady Kirsten treats you ill, that is certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Hands him the bowl.] Come, sit down and drink!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [HEMMING sits down.] Listen, Hemming! I could wish we were home
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Well, I have no fancy for this festive home.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. No, my old room at Guldvik for me;&mdash;when we sat there of an
      evening and played chess with the ale jug between us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. The while Mistress Ingeborg sat at the loom and embroidered roses
      and all sorts of flowers in the linen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And sang all the time so merrily that it seemed to me that I became
      young and active again. Yes, Hemming! when the wedding is over, we shall
      go back and live our old ways again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. But then there will be no one who works the loom and sings merry
      lays the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. No, that is true enough; Ingeborg will then be gone. It will be a
      little hard on me; she is wild and self-willed, but I shall miss her
      nevertheless,&mdash;miss her greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Considers.] Now and then I suppose I could visit her here&mdash;But
      no, that I will not! Here they laugh at me, they whisper behind my back,&mdash;I
      see it well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. But in case you wished, it could still be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Changed! You are stupid, Hemming! Always you talk about changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Hands him the bowl.] Come, drink, it will do you good. Changed; no,
      no, it shall never be changed! It was evil spirits who put into my head
      the idea of marrying into Lady Kirsten's family. But now it is done; the
      superior kinsmen will have to behave as they please, but my own relatives
      and friends shall not laugh at me,&mdash;if I have given my word, I shall
      keep it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Disheartened.] If I only knew that Olaf would be kind to her; I
      shall ask him to&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Vehemently.] He <i>shall</i> be kind, else I shall come and beat
      him with my old fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, it is well that you keep your eye on her, for Olaf cares
      little for her, I do believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. So, you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Do you remember Alfhild, the poor girl, who yesterday followed us
      down from the mountain?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Indeed I do. She is pretty!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Rises.] So thinks Olaf, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Olaf loves her! 'Tis many a time he visited her up there;&mdash;what
      Lady Kirsten has told you, you must never believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And what you blab about I believe still less. You are provoked with
      Ingeborg because at times she makes fun of you, and therefore you begrudge
      her this attractive marriage; yes, yes, I know you too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Why, master! you could believe that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Make me believe that Olaf Liljekrans loves that beggar woman! A
      noble, high-born lord such as he! It is almost as if one were to say that
      Ingeborg, my daughter, had a fancy for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Embarrassed.] For me&mdash;how could you ever imagine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. No, I don't imagine! But the one is as unreasonable as the other.
      Come, drink! and don't talk any more such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Rises.] There is Lady Kirsten with the guests. What's going to
      happen now?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. They are all to assemble out here; they will then follow the
      bride and bridegroom to the banquet-table and thence to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Aye, what a cursed custom! To the church at night! Is then marriage
      a work of darkness?

      over.

    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Softly, to HEMMING, who has been whispering with INGEBORG.]
      Well, Hemming! How do you think your master is disposed?

    <p>
      HEMMING. Alas, Lady Kirsten! I have but little hope unless you lend your
      aid.

      you are speaking of?

      HEMMING. Alas, I hardly dare believe it myself; but Lady Kirsten means
      well by us. She will soon show you that&mdash;

      INGEBORG. Hush! they are approaching.

    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Then she knows how to comfort herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Smiling.] It seems so. Only wait! This very evening you
      shall know for certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I mean that she is a sly witch. All her fair words have been
      deceitful wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. No, no, mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That we shall see! Alfhild is happy and gay,&mdash;so much I
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. It were well for me if she were!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Loudly and clearly.] Lord Arne of Guldvik! Now is the hour
      come at length which we have all, I imagine, been looking forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] Now it begins!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Soon will the church bestow its blessing on our children and
      unite them in a long and loving union.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside, startled.] What now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. The terms we have already agreed upon. But I suggest that we
      here once again seal them with hand and word.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [As before.] Heaven and earth! Is she trying to deceive me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. That is not necessary; I stand by my word like an honorable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That I well know, Lord Arne! but it will take but a moment.
      First of all, there shall be an end for all time to every quarrel and
      dispute between our families,&mdash;and as for the damages and injuries
      which our old disagreements have caused on either side, no one shall
      demand compensation for them; each must manage them as best he knows how.
      We promise that, do we not?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. That we promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      [General shaking of hands among the relatives of the bridal couple.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Softly.] Curses upon you; you lied to me shamefully!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Then we mention again, what we are already agreed upon, that
      the boundary line between Lord Arne's domains and mine shall be moved as
      far in upon his land as good and impartial men may judge to be fitting and
      just.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Yes, yes, I suppose it must be so!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That we promise, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS. That we promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shaking of hands as before.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Finally, Lord Arne shall give in the form of a dowry to his
      daughter as much silver, linen, and other furnishings as were named and
      agreed upon at the betrothal feast, all of which shall here be placed in
      my home from the day Mistress Ingeborg moves herein as my son's lawful
      wife, which is tonight. On that we are agreed?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS. That we solemnly promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shaking of hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Then let the bride and bridegroom clasp hands and go to the
      banquet-table and thence to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Aside.] Ah, Hemming can now see whether Lady Kirsten deceives me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Softly.] O, then it is all over for me; a fool I was to depend
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. But on this joyful day it is fitting that we make as many as
      possible happy. And therefore I have a request to make, Lord Arne!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Speak forth! If I can I shall gladly comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [Aside.] What does she purpose now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. There is still a young couple who would like to go to the
      altar this evening; from what I hear, they are agreed between themselves.
      The bride I shall take care of, but the bridegroom you must assist; it is
      Hemming, your page, and Alfhild!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [With a cry.] Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Likewise.] Alfhild!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. O, woe is me! Now I understand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS. [At the same time.] Hemming and Alfhild! The mountain girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughter and whispering.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Alfhild! You will marry her off to&mdash;No, no, it shall not be!
      Never, never!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Be still!&mdash;Olaf, my son; be still, I beg you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To himself.] What's this! Yes, truly, then Hemming was right; there
      is something between Olaf and Alfhild.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Whispering.] Aye, Lady Kirsten! I see your scheme. Now I know why
      Olaf wandered three days in the mountain, and now you intend to make use
      of Hemming to be rid of her. Ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [With forced composure.] Lord Arne! how can you believe such
      a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [In a low tone.] O, I see clearly! Now I should think I had very
      good reason to break the agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Softly and frightened.] Break the agreement! I beg of you!
      Will you put us all to shame?
    </p>
    <p>
      [They talk together softly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. [To INGEBORG, with whom he has in the meantime been whispering.]
      That is all there is to it, I swear. Lady Kirsten and I have not
      understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well, then decline! You shall! I command you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. No, no! I dare not; she will then see that it was you I was
      thinking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Good; then I shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Aloud.] Hemming shall not go to the altar with Alfhild;&mdash;he
      is too good to marry another man's darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [With a cry.] For shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GUESTS. Darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To INGEBORG.] What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Heaven protect us!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Cursed be my soul! She is put to shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Yes, loudly I proclaim it: she is another man's darling. Let him
      gainsay it who dares.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Ingeborg!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Aside.] What is the matter with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Softly.] So that's the way it is! She then,&mdash;she it is
      who cares for Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Softly and clearly, to ARNE.] Do you now intend to break
      the agreement? You can now see for yourself from your daughter's conduct
      what reason I had to get Hemming married!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Disconcerted.] My daughter! Could you imagine that she&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You need not pretend! Ingeborg has a fancy for your
      house-carl; now I should think I had good reason to break our agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Break, break&mdash;! What are you thinking of! To bring on me such
      disgrace!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Mocking.] Yes,&mdash;otherwise you would do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Quickly.] No, no, I have reconsidered; it is best we both keep
      still!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To herself.] See, now have I won! I know Olaf; a woman so
      scorned will never tempt him!

    <p>
      [The Preceding. ALFHILD comes unnoticed out of the storehouse in
      glittering bridal dress with a crown on her head and her hair flowing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Aside.] This has been a cursed day for me! O, he is a cunning dog,
      this Hemming! He knew that Ingeborg had a fancy for him; it was therefore
      so galling to him that Olaf should have her.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Who has in the meantime regained her composure.] And now to
      the festive hall! Hemming we can think of later.&mdash;Olaf, take your
      bride by the hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Reluctantly, as he sees INGEBORG whisper to HEMMING.] Where is the
      bride? Come, come!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD AND INGEBORG. [At the same time, as they each seize one of OLAF's
      hands.] Here I am!

      THE GUESTS. How,&mdash;she takes Olaf?
    </p>
    <p>
      [General amazement.]

    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] So far has he gone, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud, to ALFHILD.] You are mistaken! That is not your
      bridegroom!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Why, certainly, it is Olaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Lets go his hand.] If then he has promised her&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [In great agitation.] Olaf is not your bridegroom, I say!
      Tell her it yourself, my son!
    </p>
    <p>
      [OLAF is silent. LADY KIRSTEN's Kinsmen look at each other embarrassed.
      ARNE's Relatives draw nearer, angry and threatening.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [With raised voice.] Olaf Liljekrans! Answer loudly and
      clearly! You owe it to yourself and to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [In despair, struggling with himself.] Let it be as you wish then,
      mother! Yes, by all the saints! I shall answer. Alfhild! you are mistaken!
      I am not your bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Pointing to INGEBORG.] There&mdash;there stands my bride!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Withdraws a step or two dumfounded and stares at him.] She&mdash;your&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [With rising irritation.] Alfhild! go hence! Go, go, far into the
      mountain again; 'twill be best for you. I was sick and bewildered in mind
      when I wandered up there! What I have told you I little remember! I do not
      know and I do not want to know! Do you hear,&mdash;I do not want to!&mdash;The
      golden crown you can keep! Keep all, both the silver and gold, that you
      there stand dressed in. More,&mdash;yea, tenfold more you shall have.&mdash;Well!
      why do you stare at me so?
    </p>
    <p>
      [ALFHILD takes off the crown and the other adornments and places them at
      OLAF's feet as she continues uninterruptedly to stare at him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Perhaps I pretended to you that you were to be my bride tonight,
      perhaps you believed me! Perhaps you thought that Olaf Liljekrans would
      marry a&mdash;a&mdash;what was it you called her?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Stamps with his foot.] Do not stare at me so, I say! I know you
      well enough; you have bewitched me. I forgot my family; I forgot my bride,
      my betrothed, she who stands there.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Seizes ALFHILD violently by the arm.] Look at her, Alfhild! Aha, it
      is she that I love!
    </p>
    <p>
      [ALFHILD sinks down on her knees and covers her face with her hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Rise, Alfhild! rise, I say! If you dare to grieve in this way, I
      shall kill you!&mdash;Why are you not happy? Be merry and wild as I am!&mdash;And
      the rest of you! Why do you stand so silently, looking at one another?
      Laugh,&mdash;laugh loudly, so that it may echo around!&mdash;Alfhild! Why
      don't you answer? Have I not told you enough! Aha! Then add, you others, a
      word to what I have said! Come, say something, you too; Lady Kirsten would
      like it! Laugh at her, mock her, trample her under your feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [With ringing laughter.] Ha, ha, ha! She is Olaf's darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      [ALFHILD sinks down to the ground in such a way that she rests prostrate
      against the stone bench at the left. A flash of lightning illuminates the
      scene and the thunder rolls; during the following to the close of the act
      the darkness and the storm increase.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. See, see! That I like; now do the powers above join in! Right now
      will I ride to the church with my bride! Come, Mistress Ingeborg! But
      first will we drink,&mdash;yes, drink, drink! Bring here the beaker and
      horn,&mdash;not in there&mdash;! Light the candles in the church! Let the
      organ resound; prepare for a dance&mdash;not mournful psalms&mdash;fie,
      fie, no, a dance!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Thunder and lightning.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Ah, it is rumored in heaven that Olaf Liljekrans is celebrating his
      wedding!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rushes out to the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Christ save me! his reason is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Ah, have no fear; it will soon pass,&mdash;I know him.

    <p>
      [Draws ARNE aside with her.]

    <p>
      ARNE. [Gently threatening HEMMING in passing.] O, Hemming, Hemming! You
      are a sly dog!

      left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Detains HEMMING.] Hemming! I will not go to church with Olaf
      Liljekrans!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Alas, what will prevent it?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. If it comes to that, I shall say no,&mdash;no before the very
      altar itself, in the presence of all!
    </p>

   One falcon the heavens with plenty may bless,

   When the world is nothing but gall;

    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND SERVANT. Come along with us, Alfhild! You shall also have a
      torch to carry!
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVERAL. Yes, yes, you must come! It is Lord Olaf's day of glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Takes one of the torches.] Yes, yes, I will! As the most humble
      in the row I shall stand down there, and then, when he sees me, when I ask
      of him, when I remind him of everything he has promised and sworn,&mdash;O,
      tell me, tell me, do you not think that he will be kind to me again? Do
      you think so? O, tell me you do! Say that you think so!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SERVANTS. Aha,&mdash;for certain he will; now come!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They go out to the right to the rear of the house.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ALFHILD.  [Bursts into tears.]
   They mock at me, laugh at me,&mdash;one and all!
   So harsh is not even the mountain wall;
   The moss thereon is permitted to grow;
   There's no one so kind to me here!  I&mdash;I must go!

   [Thunder and lightning.]

   ALFHILD.  Ah, heaven itself is angry and grim,
   It pours out its wrath on my wretched head;
   But flash there is none to annihilate him
   Who craftily tricked me in all that he said!

   [The tones of the organ are heard from within the church.]

   ALFHILD.  O, listen!  I hear God's angel choir!
   'Tis Olaf to the altar they call!
   And I must stand here in my ragged attire
   And suffer outside the church-hall!

   [She swings the torch high in the air.]

   ALFHILD.  No, no, that I will not, thou all-highest God!
   O, tempt me no longer, forswear thee I may!

   [She is silent and listens to the organ music.]

   ALFHILD.  God's angels are singing!  From under the sod
   The dead they were able to carol away!
   O, my bosom is bursting with woe!

   [She kneels and faces the church.]

   ALFHILD.  Cease, cease your melodies tender and sweet!
   O, cease your singing; be kind, I entreat!
   Or Olaf to the altar will go!

   [Whispering and in the greatest apprehension.]

   ALFHILD.  Be still!  O, be still!  For a little while yet!
   He is lulled in a sleep that will make him forget!
   O, waken him not, else straight he will hie
   To the church&mdash;and then, alas, I must die!

   [The organ grows louder through the storm.  ALFHILD springs up,
   beside herself with despair.]

   The angels of God have forsaken me quite!
   They mock at my anguish and woe!
   They conjure him forth;&mdash;he is now in their might!
   Ah, if here in the dark, dark night I must go,
   Your bridal chamber at least shall be light!

   [She throws the torch in through the opening in the gable and
   falls down on the ground.&mdash;INGEBORG and HEMMING come hurriedly
   from behind the house.]

   HEMMING.  Now it is time.  The horse stands saddled behind the
   store house.
</pre>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. And all the servants are down at the church, are they not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Aye, rest you assured; and in the banquet house I have barred
      every shutter and door with heavy iron rings; no one can get out!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Away, then! Up to the valley which Alfhild has told of!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, up there! There no one will seek us!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They rush out to the left.&mdash;ALFHILD continues to lie motionless for
      some time. Suddenly cries and commotion are hear in the bridal house; the
      flames break out through the roof.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Jumps up in despair.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   It burns!&mdash;Aha,&mdash;I remember!  'T was here
   Too dark for my soul&mdash;it filled me with fear!
   Olaf, before it was you who smiled,
   Now it is Alfhild, so gay and so wild!&mdash;
   In the bridal house there is anguish and gloom,
   The bride is burning on the arm of the groom!
</pre>
    <p>
      [The HOUSE SERVANTS rush in one by one without torches and stand as if
      turned to stone. OLAF comes into view up in the opening, which he seeks to
      widen with desperate efforts.]
    </p>
    <h3>
      OLAF.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Alfhild!  'Tis you!  So might I have known!
   If only from out of this danger you save me,
   'T is silver and gold you shall hereafter own!
</pre>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [With wild laughter.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Too well I remember the promise you gave me!
   Now ride to the church with minstrel and priest!
   Now hold your wedding,&mdash;forget all the rest!
   Alfhild has honored you as she knew best,&mdash;
   The torch she has swung at your bridal feast!
</pre>
    <p>
      [She rushes out at the back. The SERVANTS hasten to lend their help; a
      part of the roof falls in; OLAF is seen high amidst the flames as the
      curtain falls.]

      THIRD ACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [A sunny valley, rich in flowers, trees, and vegetation of all kinds, and
      surrounded by lofty snow-capped mountains. In the center of the background
      a quiet mountain tarn; on the left side a rocky cliff which drops straight
      down to the water. On the same side nearer the front of the stage a very
      old log hut, almost entirely hidden in the dense shrubbery. The glow of
      dawn shines over the mountains; in the valley itself the day is only half
      begun; during the following scene's the sun rises.]
    </p>
    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <p>
      [ALFHILD lies sleeping and half concealed among the bushes beside the hut;
      soft music indicates her shifting dreams. OLAF comes down the hillside to
      the right. Over his wedding clothes he wears a coarse cloak.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Here it was; I know the green there this side of the tarn. It was
      yonder beneath the linden tree that I dreamed my strange dream. On the
      slope of the mountain there I stood when Alfhild for the first time came
      to meet me; I placed my betrothal ring on the string of my bow and shot;&mdash;that
      shot has proved a magic shot; it struck the huntsman himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. It is strange that when I wander up here, far from the village
      below, it seems as if another atmosphere played around me, as if a more
      vigorous blood flowed in my veins, as if I had another mind, another soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Where is she now?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I shall,&mdash;I will find her again! Up here she must come; she has
      no home out there in the cold wide world. And I&mdash;am I not also a
      homeless fugitive? Did I not become a stranger in my mother's house, a
      stranger among my kinsmen, the very first hour I met her?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Is she then a witch,&mdash;has she power over secret arts as&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. My mother! Hm! It seems to me it would scarcely be well for me to
      allow her to manage my life; she insinuates thoughts into my heart which
      do not belong there. No, no, I will find Alfhild again and ask forgiveness
      for the wrong I have done, and then&mdash;

      SCENE II
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
OLAF.  (Alfhild still sleeping.  Thorgjerd comes from
                behind the hut on the left.)
</pre>
    <p>
      OLAF. Well met, stranger!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Thanks, the same to you. You are early about!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Or late; early in the morning, but late in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. You belong in the village below, I take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. My family lives there. And you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Wherever the mind is at rest, there is one at home; that is why
      I like best to wander in here;&mdash;my neighbors shall not do me any
      injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. That I have noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Then you have been here before?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I chased a hind this summer in here; but when I look closely I see
      'tis a royal child that has been bewitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. [Looks at him sharply.] That hunt is dangerous!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. For the hunter?
    </p>
    <p>
      [THORGJERD nods.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I was sitting and thinking the same thing myself; it seems to me
      that I was bewitched on that hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Farewell and good luck to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Out upon you! If you wish a huntsman good luck he will never come
      within shot of the prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. If the shot should strike the hunter himself, the best luck
      that could happen to him would be to have no luck at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You speak wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Yes, yes; there is many a thing to be learned in here.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Too true! I have learned here the best that I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Farewell! I'll take greetings from you to your kinsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You mean to go down?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Such was my purpose. These are merry days down there, I am
      told. A mighty knight is celebrating his wedding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Then you should have been there last night; now I fear the best part
      of the fun is past.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. I dare say I'll come in time even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Perhaps! But still you should have been there last night; so bright
      and so warm a festive hall you never have seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. It was well for him who was within.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I know one who had to stand outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. Yes, yes, outside,&mdash;that is the poor man's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I know one who had to stand outside and who nevertheless was both
      worse off and better off than those within.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. I must go down,&mdash;I see that clearly; I shall play for the
      guests. Now I shall fetch my harp, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You are a minstrel?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORGJERD. And not among the worst. Now shall I fetch my harp from where
      it lies hidden near the waterfall; those strings you should hear. With
      them I sat once on the edge of the bed and played the bride out of the
      festive hall over ridge and field.&mdash;Have you never heard little
      Ingrid's lay? He who could play the bride out of the bridegroom's arms can
      surely play his child home to her father again. Farewell! If you linger
      here we may meet again when I get down there.

      SCENE III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      [OLAF. ALFHILD.]
    </h3>
    <p>
      OLAF. Ah, if it were&mdash;for certain I cannot doubt it. Alfhild herself
      said that her father played such music that no one who heard it could ever
      forget. He mentioned Lady Ingrid who disappeared on the eve of her wedding
      many years ago,&mdash;there was a young minstrel named Thorgjerd who loved
      her, so went the story. Many a strange tale was afterwards current about
      him; at times he stood right in the midst of the village and played so
      beautifully that all who heard it had to weep; but no one knew where he
      made his home. Alfhild&mdash;yes, she is his child! Here she has grown up,
      here in this desolate valley, which no one has known of by name for many a
      year; and Ingrid, who disappeared&mdash;indeed, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Becomes aware of ALFHILD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Alfhild! There she is! In her wedding garments she has fled up here.
      Here then shall you awaken after the bridal night; so sorry a day to you
      was my day of honor. You wished to go out into life, you said; you wanted
      to learn to know all the love in the world. So sorry a journey you had,
      but I swear it shall all be well again. She moves; it is as if she were
      writhing in sorrow and anguish;&mdash;when you awaken, it shall be to joy
      and delight!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Still half in dreams.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   It burns!  Oh, save him,&mdash;he is within!
   He must not die!  Life anew he must win!
</pre>
    <p>
      [She jumps up in fright; the music ceases.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Where am I! He stands here before me, it seems!
    </p>
    <p>
      Olaf Liljekrans! save me from my dreams!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   OLAF.  Alfhild! take heart, here you need fear no harm!

   ALFHILD.  [Moves away, fearfully and apprehensively.]
   You think with sweet words my soul to beguile?
   In your heart there is evil, though with lips you may smile,
   On me you shall nevermore practice your charm!

   OLAF.  Alfhild! be calm, do not start;
   'Tis Olaf I am, the friend of your heart!
   Unkind I have been, I have treated you ill;
   But deep in my heart I was faithful to you!
   I was blind and deluded and weak of will,&mdash;
   And thus I did wound you far more than I knew!
   O, can you forgive me?  Alfhild, you must,&mdash;
   I swear to you I shall be worthy your trust!
   I shall bear you aloft and smooth your way,
   And kiss from your cheek the tears of dole,
   The grief in your heart I shall try to allay,
   And heal the wound that burns in your soul!

   ALFHILD.  I know you too well and your cunning disguise.
   Since last I did see you I too have grown wise.
   You would have me believe with your wily speech
   It is you for whom I now suffer and languish.
   You would have me believe it was you that did teach
   Me to revel in joy and to writhe in anguish.
   'Twill profit you little, I know you too well,
   Whether early or late you come to my dell.
   I know you too well; for deceit on your brow
   I can read.  Not so was the other, I vow!

   OLAF.  The other?  Whom mean you?

   ALFHILD.  He that is dead!
   'Tis therefore I suffer so bitter a dread.
   You don't understand?  You must know there were two;
   And that is why peace I shall nevermore find!
   The one was all love, so good and so true,
   The other was evil, faithless, unkind;
   The one to me came on a late summer day,
   When my heart burst in flower and bloom;
   The other led me in the mountain astray,
   Where all things are shrouded in gloom!
   'Tis the evil one, you, that has come again;
   The other who loved me, so good and so kind,
   The one who will never be out of my mind,&mdash;
   Ah, him have I slain!

   [She sinks down on a stone near the house and busts into tears.]

   OLAF.  Has he stolen your peace, has he robbed you of rest,
   Then why let him longer dwell there in your breast!

   ALFHILD.  Alas, were I laid in the grave far below,
   With me, I am sure, my sorrow would go!
   I knew it not then,&mdash;to you do I swear,
   I thought it was little for him I did care;
   Now I see I must die of a grief-broken heart,
   Yet his image will never depart!

   [A short pause.]

   ALFHILD.  Have you chords in your bosom that you can command?
   It seems so; your voice sounds so pleasant and sweet;
   Pleasant&mdash;though blended it is with deceit.
   Have you chords in your breast, then go round in the land
   And sing of Alfhild a plaintive lay
   To the village girls you meet on the way:

     Only yesterday I was so little a roe,
     I roamed in the green groves around;
     They came to the forest with arrow and bow,
     And chased me with falcon and hound!

     Only yesterday I was a bird so forlorn,
     I sat 'neath the linden alone;
     They drove me away from the place I was born,
     And threw at me stone after stone.

     Only yesterday I was an untamed dove,
     Which nowhere finds peace or rest;
     They came from below, they came from above,
     And pierced with an arrow my breast!

   OLAF.  [Deeply moved.]
     Alas, that I lay in the grave below.
     Lulled in eternal rest!
     Your every word is a steel-made bow
     That strikes with an arrow my breast!

   ALFHILD.  [Jumps up with childlike joy.]
   Just so it shall be,&mdash;'tis rightfully so!
   Yes, truly, indeed, have you chords in your breast!
   So let it be sung; they easily show
   That you are yourself by my sorrow oppressed.
   They show that your own grief is just as strong
   As the one that you voice in your plaintive song!

   [She stops and looks sorrowfully at him.]

   ALFHILD.  Yet no,&mdash;you shall not sing of Alfhild's lament;
   What stranger is there whom my sorrow will move!
   From whence I came, and whither I went
   There is no one out there who shall question or prove!
   Sing rather of Olaf Liljekrans,
   Who wandered astray in the elf-maidens' dance!
   Sing of Alfhild, the false and unkind,
   Who drove his betrothed quite out of his mind;
   And sing of all the sorrow and fear,
   When dead Olaf Liljekrans lay on the bier.
   Sing of all the weeping below,
   When away they carried the three who had died!
   The one was Olaf, the other his bride!
   The third was his mother who perished of woe.

   OLAF.  Yes, Olaf is dead; it is just as you say;
   But I shall be now so faithful a friend;
   Wherever you dwell, wherever you wend,
   From your side I shall nevermore stray!
   May I suffer in full for the sin I committed,&mdash;
   Atonement to me shall be sweet.
   'Twill comfort me much if I be permitted
   To roam with you here in some far-off retreat!
   From early dawn till the end of day,
   Like a faithful hound I shall follow your lead!
   I shall clothe my remorse in so plaintive a lay
   Till finally you shall believe me indeed.
   Each moment we spent here in ecstasy
   I shall call up again to your memory!
   Each flower that blooms shall speak it anew,
   The cuckoo and swallow shall sing it to you!
   The trees that grow here in the forest so green
   Shall whisper thereof both soft and serene!

   ALFHILD.  Enough!  You would only beguile me anew;
   Far better were it for you now to depart!
   So fair is the falsehood I see within you,
   So faithless the thoughts that dwell in your heart!
   What would you up here?  What is it you want?
   You think that you know the place that you haunt?
   So pleasant a spot was this valley of yore,
   A curse lies upon it forevermore!
   In the past, when lone in the forest I went,
   The leaves on the trees had so fragrant a scent!
   The flowers bloomed forth on my every side,
   When you pressed me to you and called me your bride!
   But now&mdash;the whole valley is burned in the night;
   The trees are burned to the left and the right;
   The straw and the leaves are withered away,
   Each flower is turned to a dusty gray!&mdash;

   ALFHILD.  Yes, clearly I see,&mdash;in a single night
   Is the world become old!&mdash;When I wandered below
   All alone, and sank down 'neath my shame and my woe,
   Then faded the world and its golden delight.
   All things but deceit have vanished away;
   So much have I learned on my bridal day!
   My father lied; he was wrong when he said
   The dead are borne to the dwelling of God;
   But Olaf knew better the fate of the dead:
   The dead sink below, far under the sod!

   ALFHILD.  [She breaks out in deepest agony.]
   Ah, well do I see now you knew what you did;
   For low in the grave my body is hid.

   OLAF.  Alfhild!  Your words deal so crushing a blow!
   O, God! was your heart once so young and so bold&mdash;
   Forgive me my sin and forget all your woe!

   ALFHILD.  [With marked and increasing bewilderment.]
   Hush, do not speak to me!  Olaf, behold!
   A corpse they carry, to the grave they creep;
   But no mother is there, no children who weep,
   No pillows are there of blue or of red,&mdash;
   Alfhild on shavings and straw lies dead!
   I shall never ride now to the heaven above,
   And awake in the arms of the God of love.
   No mother have I whose heart will break,
   No one who follows and weeps for my sake;
   No person have I in the world so wide,
   Who weeps for me at the bier,&mdash;
   No angels to scatter on every side
   Blue pearls in the heavenly sphere;
   And ne'er shall I reach the dwelling of God,
   Where the dead dream only of mirth!

   OLAF.  Alfhild!

   ALFHILD.  They lower me under the sod!
   They cover me over with earth!
   And here must I lie with all my dread,
   Must live and suffer although I be dead:
   Must know there is nothing now left for me,
   Yet cannot forget, nor fight myself free;
   Must hear when he whom my love I gave
   Rides off to the church right over my grave;
   Must hear him forever suffer and languish,
   And yet can not lessen his anguish!
   O, how my bosom is filled with despair!
   The angels of God have forgotten my prayer!
   They heed no longer my weeping and woe&mdash;
   The portal is closed to the heavenly bliss&mdash;
   Dig me up again!  Let me not lie here below!

   [She rushes out to the left.]

   OLAF.  Alfhild!  Alfhild!  O, Christ, what is this?

   [He follows her quickly.]

      SCENE IV

    <p>
      [INGEBORG and HEMMING enter, after a pause, from the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well, here we are up here! How lovely and bright and peaceful it
      is!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, here we shall live happily together!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. But mark you well that you are my servant, and nothing else,&mdash;until
      my father has given his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. That he will never do!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Never you mind,&mdash;we'll find some means or other.&mdash;But
      now we must think about choosing a cabin to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. There are plenty of them around here. Over the whole valley there
      are deserted huts; everything is just the same as it was when the last
      people died in the terrible plague many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Here I like it very much! Over there, too, there is just such an
      old hut; the water is near by, and the forest must surely be alive with
      game. You can fish and hunt; aye, we shall live a wonderful life!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yea, forsooth, a wonderful life! I shall fish and hunt the while
      you gather berries and keep the house in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Do I? No, that you must take care of!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, yes, as you please. O, a delightful life we shall live!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops and adds somewhat dejectedly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. But when I stop to think a bit;&mdash;I have neither bow nor
      fishing outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Likewise with an expression of despondency.] And it occurs to
      me there are no servants here who can help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. That shall I willingly do!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. No, thanks.&mdash;And all my good clothes&mdash;I didn't bring
      anything along except my bridal gown which I am wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. That was thoughtless of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. True enough, Hemming! And for that reason you shall steal down
      to Guldvik some night and bring me clothes and other things as much as I
      have need of.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. And be hanged as a thief!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. No, you shall be careful and cautious,&mdash;that I warn you.
      But when finally the long winter comes? There are no people up here,&mdash;music
      and dancing we shall never have&mdash;Hemming! Shall we stay here or&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Well, where else is there we can go?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Impatiently.] Yes, but human beings cannot live here!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Why, surely, they can!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well, you see yourself they are all of them dead! Hemming! I
      think it best I go home to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. But what will become of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. You shall go to war!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. To war! And be killed!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Not at all! You shall perform some illustrious deed, and then
      will you be made a knight, and then will my father no longer be opposed to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEMMING. Yes, but what if they kill me in the meantime?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well, we'll have plenty of time to think about that. Today and
      tomorrow we shall have to remain here, I suppose; so long will the guests
      sit in the festive house and celebrate,&mdash;if they look for us, it will
      probably be about in the village; up here we can be safe and&mdash;

      HEMMING. Yes, but&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      OLAF. [Aside.] I will not stir from here!

      INGEBORG. [Aloud, as she draws nearer.] Olaf Liljekrans! Now you have me;
      but you will do ill if you try to compel me.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. That is furthest from my mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Why then come you here in company with my kinsmen?

    <p>
      OLAF. Do I? On the contrary, it is you who&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. That invention won't fool me; only a moment ago I saw the whole
      crowd&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Who? Who?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      INGEBORG. Of course, she is with them. But how can that frighten you?

      ha, ha! What an idea! Come, shall we two be honest with each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Yes, that is exactly what I had in mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well, then, tell me, at what hour came you up here?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      INGEBORG. I, too!

    <p>
      OLAF. You!

      INGEBORG. Hush, we have only a moment or two! And you fled up here because
      you had but little desire to go to the altar with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Aye, how can you think&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Yes, that I can easily think. Answer me now; we were to speak
      honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Well, then, it was therefore that I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Well and good, I did likewise!

    <p>
      OLAF. You, Ingeborg!

    <p>
      OLAF. Well, it can't be denied!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. I, too! Aha,&mdash;'tis a jolly coincidence; I fled from you,
      and you from me! We both fled up here, and now just as our relatives are
      after us we meet again! Listen, Olaf Liljekrans! Say we promise not to
      betray one another!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. But now we must part!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I understand!

    <p>
      INGEBORG. For, if they found us together, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Yes, then it would be still more difficult for you to be rid of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Farewell! If ever I come to have a wedding you shall be my
      bride's man.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. And if anything like that should happen to me, you will, I am sure,
      accommodate me in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. Of course! Farewell! Farewell! And do not think unkindly of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Indeed not; I shall give you my hand wherever we meet!

    <p>
      INGEBORG. I, too! Wherever we meet&mdash;only not at the altar.

      SCENE VI

    <p>
      [LADY KIRSTEN, ARNE of Guldvik, WEDDING GUESTS, PEASANTS and SERVANTS from
      the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. See, here will we begin the hunt. Our people must spread
      about and search all around the tarn;&mdash;she shall come forth and then&mdash;woe
      upon her! no mercy or pity is there in my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. What will you do then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Hold judgment upon her&mdash;right on the spot where she is
      found! All the damage she has done on my dominions I have power and
      authority to punish in accordance with reason and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Yes, but what good is that? What is lost can not thereby be won back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. No, but I shall get revenge, and that is no little gain.
      Revenge,&mdash;revenge I must have, if I am to bear and live down my loss
      and all the shame she has brought upon me. The storm last night ruined the
      whole of my year's crop; not a single uninjured straw is left in my
      fields; and in here, where she herself has said she has her home, here
      everything thrives and blossoms more luxuriantly than I have ever seen! Is
      not that the operation of secret arts? Olaf she has snared so securely in
      her devilish net that he fled out of the village in the wildest storm to
      follow her. My house she burned clear to the ground; all the openings and
      doors she barred on the outside;&mdash;it was a miracle of God that the
      servants brought their timely help!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Alas, alas; I am afraid if has cost two lives that I thought much
      of,&mdash;Ingeborg and my man Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Come, come, Lord Arne! You must not completely despair of
      them yet. Ingeborg may have escaped after all; the rest of us came out of
      it untouched in spite of the cunning of the cursed witch;&mdash;Ingeborg
      has been bewildered with fright and has sought refuge somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Yes, yes, that may be the case with Ingeborg; but Hemming is past
      all hope,&mdash;of that I am sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. O, he had become such a sly and contriving devil of late! He has let
      himself be shut in and burnt merely to get revenge over me; he knows I
      can't get along for a single day without him. O, I know him!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Well, however it is, Alfhild we must capture; she shall be
      tried, condemned, and punished; I have misdeeds a plenty to charge her
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. And I can mention a few in case it is necessary; she has stolen my
      dapple-gray horse from the stable; this morning it was gone with saddle
      and bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Ingeborg and Hemming gone, and his horse likewise;
      were I in his place I should know what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Now let us divide and go about in small groups; he
      who first gets his eye on Alfhild shall blow the trumpet or horn; let the
      rest listen and follow the sound till we are assembled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They go out at different sides.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Who alone has remained.] And I, who am not acquainted here,&mdash;how
      am I to find my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Calls.] Hemming! Hemming!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. I forgot,&mdash;he is&mdash;

   ALFHILD.  I have wailed, I have wept, till my heart is sore;
   I am weary and tired, I can weep no more!

   [Sinks down on a stone in the foreground.]

   ALFHILD.  First to my father farewell I shall say!
   Then into the mountains I make my way!
   Down here I see Olaf wherever I go;
   I must up in the heights to steel my mind!
   I must deaden my grief, forget what I know,
   And leave all the memories dear behind!

   ALFHILD.  The life in my dream had so rosy a hue!
   'Tis nothing but fiction, nothing is true,&mdash;
   'Tis nothing but nonsense and shifting lies;
   Naught can be seized and held in the hand.
   Naught must be looked at with open eyes,
   Nothing stands proof when we understand!

   [The sound of trumpets is heard from the wood.]

   ALFHILD.  My mother's heirlooms I take with me;
   I shall bury them deep in the ground!
   I shall bury them deep 'neath the tall birch tree,
   Over yonder where Olaf I found!

   [She opens her bundle and takes out a bridal crown and other
   ornaments.]

   ALFHILD.  This crown did my mother once wear on her head;
   She too by the world then was tricked and misled,
   She too then in love and its power believed.
   Was she too so rudely deceived?
   Was it only in jest that my father did sing
   The pleasures that gladden the human breast?
   Ah, then he should never have said anything;
   His songs have robbed me of earthly rest;
   His songs built a home for the ecstasies
   Of life in my heart,&mdash;now in ruin it lies!

   [The trumpets are heard again.]

   ALFHILD.  Silver indeed is a metal of worth,
   'Twill never crumble like autumn hay.
   Were it hid for a thousand years in the earth,
   It would still glitter bright, it would never decay!
   The pleasures of life are like autumn hay,
   And sorrow like silver that glitters alway!

   [Ties the ornaments together in the bundle.]

   ALFHILD.  A magic treasure I often recall,
   From which dropped nine glorious pearls every night;
   But no matter how many the pearls it let fall,
   The treasure remained just as big and as bright!

   ALFHILD.  A treasure of magic, this sorrow of mine,
   And from it shall drip by night and by day,
   Not nine,&mdash;but ten thousand pearls that shine,&mdash;
   Yet the treasure shall never decay!&mdash;
   Yes, the world has made me so wise,&mdash;so wise!
   Once I followed the clouds in their flight,
   Flew dreaming with them on their path in the skies,
   And called them the swans of the light!
   I thought that the trees spread their branches so wide,
   That I might walk in the shade;
   I thought there was life in the mountain side.
   A sorry mistake I have made.
   Now I know better;&mdash;for man alone
   Can revel in joy, can suffer despair.
   In tree and in flower, friend there is none,&mdash;
   My sorrow alone I must bear.

      various sides. Later OLAF LILJEKRANS.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. There she is! Stand still, Alfhild! Do not try to escape,&mdash;else
      we shall shoot you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. What do you want of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That you shall learn soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Points to her bundle.] What is this you are carrying?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. My mother's treasures!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Give it here! See, see! A crown of silver! Indeed, Alfhild!
      If you are your mother's only daughter I am very much afraid the bridal
      crown will nevermore be needed in her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To the Servants.] Bind her! She stands there and pretends
      to be sad; no one can know what she is scheming.
    </p>
    <p>
      [ALFHILD is bound.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud and with suppressed passion.] The court is ready. As
      you all know, I have a legal and prescriptive right to protect my
      dominions, to pass judgment in accordance with the law of the realm on
      every one who does me harm on my own lands. This is what you, Alfhild,
      have presumed to do, and it is therefore that you now stand here accused
      before your judge. Defend yourself if you can, but do not forget it is a
      matter of life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But listen, Lady Kirsten!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Excuse me, Lord Arne! I am within my rights here, and I
      intend to insist on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To ALFHILD.] Come forward and answer me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Do you but question me,&mdash;I shall answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Many and grievous are the charges that are directed against
      you. First and foremost I charge you here with having beguiled my son,
      Olaf Liljekrans, with your unholy arts, so that he turned heart and soul
      away from his betrothed to whom he was pledged,&mdash;so that he, sick in
      heart, never at any time found peace in his home, but came up here to this
      unknown valley where you have had your home. All this could not have
      happened in any ordinary way; you are therefore accused of witchcraft,&mdash;defend
      yourself if you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I have little to say in answer to this. Witchcraft you call that
      strange power that drew Olaf up here. Perhaps you are right; but this
      witchcraft was not of evil;&mdash;every hour that Olaf has been here God
      must surely have witnessed! Each thought that I have had of Olaf the
      angels of God must have known! And they had no occasion to blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Enough, enough! You would add blasphemy to your
      transgression! Woe upon you, Alfhild! Your every word only adds weight to
      the scales. Yet, that is your affair!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To the rest.] I crave you all as witnesses to her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Turns to ALFHILD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. I charge you next with having again, this very night, with
      the aid of these same secret powers, met Olaf up here, and furthermore
      that you keep him concealed in here!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. There you are right! Secretly is he hidden here!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You admit it?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Yes, but however powerful you are, you will never be able to set
      him free. Perhaps it would be best for me if you were able; but neither
      you nor the whole wide world have the power to set him free!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [In a violent outburst.] Now death will certainly be your
      punishment! Out with it,&mdash;where have you got him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Presses her hands to her bosom.] In here&mdash;in my heart! If
      you can tear him out from it you can practice witchcraft better than I!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. That answer is nothing. Out with it,&mdash;where is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I have answered!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [With repressed irritation.] Good!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [To the spectators.] Were Hemming alive he would have been able to
      get the truth out of her; he had become so crafty of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Now the third charge against you: last night you set fire to
      my house and burned it clear to the ground. Perhaps human life has been
      lost,&mdash;that we not know as yet,&mdash;but whether or no, it will
      neither harm nor help your cause; for your intention to burn all of us is
      as clear as day. Do you deny my charge that you set fire to my home last
      night?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I do not deny it; I have destroyed your house!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. And how will you extenuate your action?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [With bitter mockery.] You shall not be able to say that you
      acted over hastily. Good opportunity you had, so far as I can remember, to
      stop and consider; you stood outside there, no one came near you, no one
      prevented you from deliberating as calmly as you could. Nor shall you say
      that the merriment of the festive occasion went to your head, nor that the
      wine distracted you; for you were not on the inside at all; you stood on
      the outside, and it was cool enough there,&mdash;the biting wind should
      have made you sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Yes, I destroyed your house last night; but you and Olaf and all
      the rest of you out there have done me a greater wrong. The world was to
      me a festive hall which belonged to the Great Father. The blue heaven was
      its roof, the stars were the lamps that shone from its ceiling. I wandered
      happy and rich in all this; but you, you threw a brand right in the midst
      of this golden splendor; now is everything withered and dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Such talk will profit you little! Still once more I ask,
      where is Olaf Liljekrans, my son?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I have answered!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Then you have also passed your own sentence, and I shall
      confirm it.
    </p>
    <p>
      [OLAF appears on the rocky cliff among the trees, unnoticed by the rest.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Aside.] Alfhild! God help me! What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Withdraws unseen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You have, in accordance with the law of the land, incurred
      the penalty of death as guilty of witchcraft and arson. This sentence is
      herewith pronounced upon you, and forthwith right here on the spot it
      shall be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But listen, Lady Kirsten!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Judgment is pronounced! Alfhild shall die!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. Do as you please; little shall I be of hindrance to you. When
      Olaf denied his love, then ceased my life,&mdash;I live no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Take her up on the rocky ledge over there.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Two Servants take ALFHILD up.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. For the last time, Alfhild! Give me back my son!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. I will answer no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Just as you please!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To the Servants.] Cast her down! No, wait! I have an idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [To ALFHILD.] As you stand there, I remember you again as
      you yesterday came forward with the golden crown and thought you were
      worthy to be Olaf Liljekrans' bride. Now we soon shall see how much you
      are worth; there are present here peasants and servants and many humble
      men;&mdash;perhaps your life can still be saved! Yes, Alfhild! You stare
      at me, but so it is; I will be merciful to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. (Turns to the rest.) You all know the old custom, that when
      a woman is sentenced to death for a capital offence, as she is, her life
      will be saved and she will be free if an irreproachable man comes forth
      and upholds her innocence and declares himself ready and willing to marry
      her. That custom you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Bursting into tears.] O, to be mocked,&mdash;mocked so terribly
      in my last hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Well then, Alfhild! This custom you shall have the benefit
      of. If the most humble man in my company comes forth and declares himself
      willing to marry you, then are you free.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Looks about.] Is there no one who applies?
    </p>
    <p>
      [All are silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Give her the silver crown; that shall go in the bargain;
      perhaps, Alfhild, you will then rise in value!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The crown is placed on ALFHILD's head.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. For the second time I ask,&mdash;is any one willing to save
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      [She looks about. All are silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Now for it; I am afraid your moments are numbered. Hear me
      well, you servants up there! Should no one answer my third call, then do
      you watch for a sign from me and cast her into the lake! Use now your
      arts, Alfhild! See if you can conjure yourself free from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [With a loud voice.] For the last time! There stands the
      witch and incendiary! Who will save and marry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      [She looks about. All are silent.&mdash;LADY KIRSTEN raises her hand
      quickly as a signal, the Servants seize ALFHILD; in the same moment OLAF
      rushes out on the ledge in full wedding garb.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. I will save and marry her!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He thrusts the SERVANTS aside and unbinds her. ALFHILD sinks with a cry
      on his bosom; he puts his left arm around her and raises his right arm
      threateningly in the air.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. [Stand as if turned to stone.] Olaf Liljekrans!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Olaf Liljekrans, my son! What have you done? Disgraced
      yourself for all time!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. No, I blot out the shame and disgrace which I brought on myself by
      my treatment of her! My sin I shall expiate and make myself happy the
      while!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. [Brings ALFHILD forward.] Yes, before all of you I solemnly proclaim
      this young woman my bride! She is innocent of all that has been charged
      against her; I only have transgressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Kneels before her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. And at your feet I beg you to forget and forgive&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [Raises him.] Ah, Olaf! You have given me back all the glory of
      the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You will marry her! Well and good; then am I no longer a
      mother to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. You will cause me great sorrow, although it is now long since that
      you were a real mother to me. You used me merely to build aloft your own
      pride, and I was weak and acquiesced. But now have I won power and will;
      now I stand firmly on my own feet and lay the foundation of my own
      happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. But do you stop to consider&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Nothing will I now consider,&mdash;I know what I want. Now first I
      understand my strange dream. It was prophesied of me that I was to find
      the fairest of flowers,&mdash;that I was to tear it asunder and strew it
      to all the winds. O, thus it has happened! A woman's heart is the fairest
      flower in the world; all its rich and golden leaves I have torn asunder
      and scattered to the winds. But be of good cheer, my Alfhild! Many a seed
      has gone too, and sorrow has ripened it, and from it shall grow a rich
      life for us here in the valley; for here shall we live and be happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. O, now I am happy as in the first hour we met.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aside.] Ingeborg is gone; this rich valley belongs to
      Alfhild,&mdash;no one else has a claim to it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. [Aloud.] Well, Olaf! I shall not stand in the way of your
      happiness. If you think you will find it in this way, then&mdash;well,
      then you have my consent!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Thanks, mother, thanks! Now I lack nothing more!
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFHILD. [To LADY KIRSTEN.] And me you forgive all my sin?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. Yes, yes! Perhaps I too was wrong,&mdash;let us not say any
      more of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But I, then? And my daughter, whom Olaf had pledged&mdash;Yet, it is
      true, perhaps she is no longer alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Of course she's alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. She lives! Where is she? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. That I can not say; but I may say that we both in all friendliness
      have broken our pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY KIRSTEN. You see, Lord Arne! that I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. Well, my daughter shall not be forced upon any one. Alfhild was
      fated to marry a knight; the same may happen to Ingeborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [With dignity.] Noble lords and honorable men, hear me! It has come
      to my ear that many of you hold me to be little skilled in courtly manners
      and customs. I will show you now you are completely mistaken. In the old
      chronicles it is frequently told that when a noble king loses his daughter
      he promises her hand and half his kingdom to him who may find her; he who
      finds Ingeborg shall receive her hand in marriage and in addition half of
      all that I own and possess. Are you with me on that?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE YOUNG MEN. Yes, yes!

      avail you; you have given your word!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. But that did not apply to him! Now I see it all right; he has taken
      you away himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. No, to the contrary, father! It was I who took him away!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNE. [Frightened.] Will you be silent with such words! Are you out of
      your head?
    </p>
    <p>
      INGEBORG. [Softly.] Then say "yes" right here on the spot! Otherwise I
      shall proclaim to all people that it was I who&mdash;

    <p>
      ALL. Her father!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLAF. Yes, yes, old man! There are people and merriment in here today, and
      hereafter it shall always be thus. It is your daughter's wedding we are
      celebrating; for love has she chosen her betrothed, of love have you sung
      for her,&mdash;you will not stand in our way!

  ALFHILD.  And you will remain with us!

  THORGJERD.  No, no, Alfhild!
  A minstrel has never a place to rest,
  His soul fares afar, he forever must roam!
  For he who has music deep down in his breast,
  Is never in mountains or lowlands at home;
  In the meadows green, in the sheltering bower,
  He must touch the strings and sing every hour,
  He must watch for the life that lives in the shower,
  Beneath the wild fjord, in the rushing stream,
  Must watch for the life that beats in the soul,
  And clothe in music what people but dream,
  And give voice to its sorrow and dole!

  OLAF.  But sometime you will surely visit us here!
  Now shall 'mid the birches a hall be erected;
  Here, my Alfhild! shall you be protected.
  I and my love will always be near,
  No more shall your eye be dimmed with a tear!

  ALFHILD.  Yes, now I see,&mdash;life is precious and kind!
  Rich as the fairest dream of the mind!
  So dreary and black is never our sorrow,&mdash;
  'Tis followed sometime by a bright sunny morrow!

  ALFHILD.  [Kneels.]  O angels of God! you have led me aright,
  Again you have granted me solace and bliss!
  You guided my wandering past the abyss,
  You steadied my foot that was weak and slight!
  O, if with my mind I cannot understand,&mdash;
  With my heart I'll believe to the last!
  Yes, heavenly powers!  You still watch o'er the land!
  Clear is the sun when the dark storm is passed;&mdash;
  From death and destruction my love did you save:
  So now then let happen what may!
  For now I am cheerful, now am I brave,
  Ready for life and its motley affray!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
